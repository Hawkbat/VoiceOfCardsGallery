800010,"What matters most in 
life differs depending 
on the person; for him,
it's money. Slaying the 
{CARDNAME:4010} may make him a 
hero, but more 
importantly, it'll make 
him rich."
800011,"Once he and his sister-
turned-monster fled the 
island, money became 
more than a means to an 
end: it became 
salvation. He turned to 
bounty hunting so he and 
his sister could survive."
800020,"It was love at first
""coo"" when our
freewheeling bounty
hunter met {CARDNAME:1020}, and
they've been inseparable
ever since. Who says
bounty hunters can't
have a soft side?"
800021,"""I'm sooo hungryyy. Can
we please eeeaaat?"" Our
hero's companion wasn't
just human—she was his
own sister! Alas, it
would seem that time
stopped for her the day
she was transformed..."
800030,"This dark and twisty
mage harbors a deep-
seated grudge against
the {CARDNAME:4010}, but
knows her own limits.
She desires power enough
to slay the {CARDNAME:4010}
with a single blow."
800031,"At last, the dark mage
has power. Superhuman
power! And still, the
only time a smile plays
across her lips is when
she's punching the
daylights out of our
self-proclaimed hero."
800040,"""Wait! I know that
sound..."" The tones of
a most familiar flute
pull this lively young
lady away from her fruit
gathering chores and
toward our merry band
of rogues."
800041,"She carries a book she
has read many, many
times before, and is
never happier than when
she has the time to let
its pages carry her away
on its soaring visions
of the future."
800050,"The day begins early for
this aspiring 
adventurer! Each and
every day he rises
with the sun and gulps
down a helping of
{CARDNAME:51116}
made by his father."
800051,"Should the
{CARDNAME:51116}'s
effects wear off, he
supposedly sheds his
muscle all at once in a
pitiful transformation—
or so he says. No one's
ever seen it."
800060,"{CARDNAME:1110} was born into
the Ivory Order and
raised as a dignified
lady. Her fellow Order
members find her mage
training a boon on
their travels."
800061,"Between the overly
talkative sage and the
taciturn warrior,
{CARDNAME:1110}'s journey was
far from easy. The
worst part, though? Her
pristine white robes
were soiled!"
800070,"The Ivory Order values
warriors as levelheaded
and trustworthy as
{CARDNAME:1120}. Warriors who
approach wood-chopping
and bodyguard detail
with equal amounts of
intensity and fortitude."
800071,"If ordered to advance,
{CARDNAME:1120} will follow that
to the letter, smashing
through anything in his
path, be it a wall or an
entire house. Thus, he
was deemed perfect for
{CARDNAME:1110}'s escort."
800080,"The entire Ivory Order
reveres {CARDNAME:1130} for his
wisdom. When a young
woman was placed in his
care, his obsessive
focus on etiquette
revealed another side:
exacting disciplinarian."
800081,"""{CARDNAME:1110}! No!
Stop that this instant!""
Those who know {CARDNAME:1130}
best say his jet-black
hair began turning white
the day young {CARDNAME:1110}
was placed in his care."
800090,"No ruler is safe from
fear and worry, but
Queen Nilla harbors
a knot in her gut
unrelated to—and more
personal than—the recent
rise in monster
activity."
800091,"Imposing though the
sacred throne may be, it
is far from comfortable.
Her Highness's royal...
seat, shall we say,
frequently cries out
for something
more plush."
800100,"{CARDNAME:2030} wasted no time
distinguishing himself
in the Ivory Order. His
character and aptitude
earned him the title of
Ivory Knight at an
exceedingly young age."
800101,"{CARDNAME:2030}'s success was
driven by an intense
hatred for the Ivory
Order, who distributed
their medicine knowing
full well what it could
do to people. If only
his parents had known..."
800110,"Cyprienambre is a
longtime scholar of
monsters and monster
behavior. Most people in
his village simply call
him {CARDNAME:2061}."
800111,"Cyprie studies monsters
for the sake of his
daughter. A daughter
whom, curiously, no one
has ever seen."
800120,"Either through bad luck
or too trusting a heart,
{CARDNAME:2110} has
endured no shortage of
hardship despite living
in secluded Woodland."
800121,"You might think the
repeated swindlings
would get her down,
but that would require
that she realize she's
been defrauded. Perhaps
ignorance really
is bliss."
800130,"A traveling gourmand in
his younger days, the
headman has long been
fond of monsters—so much
so, he founded {CARDNAME:91060},
where humans and
monsters coexist!"
800131,"""Looks don't tell the
whole story! Even the
most inedible-looking
things can harbor
incredible flavors,"" the
headman explains, his
table filled with dishes
never before seen..."
800140,"{CARDNAME:2090} develops various
supplements at his
nutrition clinic in
{CARDNAME:91070}—a few of which
he even gave to the
royal family in lieu
of tax once!
Or so he claims."
800141,"He'll tell you men keep
nutritional secrets to
avoid disclosing his
formula, but he'll note
it's nothing like the
Ivory Order's medicine.
Rumor is, though, that
boogers are involved..."
800150,"Seolfor is a peculiar
man who calls himself
the Overseer. He once
served dutifully as a
knight of the Ivory
Order to protect
his beloved family."
800151,"Seolfor takes it upon
himself to help
villagers enter the
afterlife. Some of the
villagers he has bid
farewell may very
well have been his
family."
800160,"This seaman prides
himself on his strength,
and claims none in his
village can best him. He
trains every day in the
hopes of becoming
what he calls the
""ultimate man."""
800161,"His training regimen is
diverse, comprising
handicrafts, cooking,
singing, gardening,
fortune-telling, and
calligraphy. Strength
training? Who said
anything about that?"
800170,"Though they share a
birthplace, {CARDNAME:2040}'s
magical might far
outstrips {CARDNAME:1030}'s. He
is now the {CARDNAME:4010}'s
stalwart companion, and
is ever wary of the
Ivory Order."
800171,"His journey revealed to
him the awful secret
that binds the {CARDNAME:4010} to
the Ivory Order. As he
fell into the heart of
the volcano, he had the
peace of knowing he'd
fulfilled his duty."
800180,"Though sworn to protect
the {CARDNAME:4010}, she never
forgave him for killing
her parents. Pushed to
the brink, she forsook
her oath to protect him
and swore she would have
her revenge."
800181,"The time has come to pay
the price of forbidden
magic. Having heard the
{CARDNAME:4010}'s plight, she
does so not knowing if
he was truly deserving
of the retribution she
sought."
801010,"Every morning she 
wakes up early to get 
breakfast ready. And 
every morning she has 
to take her husband's 
abuse. There's only so 
much a woman can stomach."
801011,"The mornings are quiet now, 
save for the soft sounds of 
chopping. Her husband 
vanished some days ago, and 
ever since, meat's been on 
the menu more often than 
not."
801020,"He made a promise to the
love of his life when
they were married: ""I
shall love you till
death do us part."" One
half-century later, he
has proven to be a man
of his word."
801021,"His wife now lies in
bed, illness slowly
claiming her. He takes
her hand, decades of
memories washing over
him. Finally, he sighs,
he'll be through with
his promise."
801030,"Not a day passed that he
didn't wear his hair or
arrange his clothes just
the way she liked. She
was the prettiest girl
in the village, and one
day he was sure she'd
notice him."
801031,"Before long the village
was full of men who
dressed the same and
wore their hair the
exact same way. She
ceased to be able to
tell any of them
apart."
801040,"This little boy loves
climbing trees; just you
watch! Today, he's gonna
climb the big tree in
the square!"
801041,"This little boy loves
his big sister! Today
he's gonna climb a tree
to have a look-see in
his sister's room!"
801050,"Rain patters the window.
A picture book lies open.
Paper and paint perfume.
Tiny fingers turn the page."
801051,"The book is upside down.
No more light in her eyes.
Only memories of Mother.
A painted rainbow bleeds."
801060,"Everyone wears a mask
and cloak, white as the
driven snow. This suits
her just fine. More than
fine. One might say she
joined the Ivory Order
just to wear it. One
wouldn't be wrong."
801061,"Her undeniable beauty
brought her attention.
Endless suitors, each
marriage proposal more
insufferable than the
last. The mask and cloak
gave her peace
once more."
801070,"He was taciturn. Kept
his head down and did
his duty. Not one of his
comrades could ever
recall hearing his
voice."
801071,"The shield is heavy;
the robes, suffocating.
Sweat soaks his mask.
Battling the heat, who
has energy to talk?
Not this guy."
801080,"Traumatized by the
bullying he received as a
child, he vowed he'd
never let anyone get the
better of him again. His
pain was the springboard
for the body now before
you."
801081,"Elsewhere, another boy
masked his own body
issues by teasing
another. Fearing
retribution he, too,
bulked up. Thus did the
world gain two
absolutely ripped men."
801090,"I want to be cute and
stylish, sure, but I
REALLY want to live
happily ever after!
Visions of a ring with
a big old diamond on it
dance in my dreams!"
801091,"But nobody gave me that
ring. So you know what
I did? Well, just look
at these muscles!
Aren't they cute?
And they shine brighter
than any diamond!"
801100,"He's lived in these
vast, dense woods for
years now. Fruit from
the trees feeds him, the
river quenches his
thirst. He gives all his
thanks to the great
Mother Earth."
801101,"He's wandered these
deceitful, bewildering
woods for ages. He knows
he will not find home,
no matter how many times
he begs or tears he
sheds. He is doomed to
wander for another day."
801110,"I know he takes no
notice of me. I've made
my peace with that. I'll
be happy so long as I
can watch him from the
shadows."
801111,"This place is a
paradise! So many trees
from which to gaze upon
him—from all angles,
every day of the year.
Forever and always."
801120,"The loss of her family
took her to the brink
of ending her own life.
Then she heard about an
island where anyone
could find happiness."
801121,"No one on the island had
any worries. They hadn't
the intellect to worry
in the first place. In
time, neither did she,
and the days bled into
one blissful blur."
801130,"""Well would you look at
that!"" the old man calls
to his wife. ""Come look at
all these butterflies flying
around me! They're
beautiful!"""
801131,"He smiles so widely his
eyes narrow. Torn
butterfly wings and legs
spill out from the gaps
between his teeth."
801140,"He was a sickly child
who spent his days
gazing out the window,
longing to run and play
with the others. If he
could just do that,
taking the bitterest
medicine was cake."
801141,"The boy grew up to see
his wish come true.
He now runs around
all day to nowhere in
particular, screaming
nonsense as he goes."
801200,"He confessed his love
to her, and asked her to
live together with him.
He pledged to make her
happy. She nodded, and
agreed readily."
801201,"Another fully booked
night at the inn. All
men, all apparently on
long stays, each one
happy they get to live
with her."
801210,"""Hello there! Striking
out on your own, are
you? Oh, I've been at
this long enough to size
people up at a glance!
Don't worry, I'll make
you exactly what
you need."""
801211,"""You saw him, right?
Real scrawny-looking.
You'll have no problem
taking his money, and
I'll have no problem
staying in business.
It's a win-win."""
801220,"Her moist, glistening eyes,
the lone bright spot in her
dimly lit shop, locked on
me as soon as I set foot
inside. Her uncanny,
croaking laughter sent
shivers down my spine."
801221,"Service with a smile, they
always say. Well, I think
I've got something that'll
cure this poor customer.
Look at 'em, shaking like
a leaf..."
801230,"She was a quick hire.
Her gentle disposition
was sure to attract a few
more customers, they
figured. No one was
prepared for the crush of
customers that ensued."
801231,"Her hiring was ultimately
a failure. The damages
wrought by her
carelessness far
outweighed the profits
and left the store
a shambles."
801240,"Rumors abound that the
sweet, innocent boy who
greets patrons of the
game parlor receives a
small bonus from the
owner whenever the house
wins in a game of cards."
801241,"Presenting a consistent
image at every venue,
these quadruplets are
hard at work in the
land's game parlors in
the hopes of paying back
their parents' gambling
arrears."
801250,"At first it has four legs.
Then two. Then three.
In the end, it has 10 legs.
What is it?"
801251,"The answer is me! Ah,
may I pass peacefully into
the next life in the
driver's seat of this gently
swaying carriage! I love
it so."
810110,"You know what they say:
Your hero's journey
hasn't begun until
you've squashed a couple
of slimes underfoot."
810111,"Though the vast majority
are killed when they're
young, those few that do
survive into adulthood
reportedly grow large
enough to swallow
villages whole."
810120,"These slimes have
learned how to wield
human weaponry. Most all
who have taken them
lightly have paid with
their lives."
810121,"Well, ""learned to wield""
is perhaps overstating
things. They still
primarily attack by
ramming their gooey body
into their enemies, but
now they do so while
brandishing a sword."
810130,"Known to many a traveler
as the ""Death Slime,""
the poison in these
gelatinous cretins can
consume flesh. Reports
of Poison Slimes
swallowing creatures
whole are not uncommon."
810131,"Their nonthreatening
demeanor makes them
highly approachable, but
those who get too close
are rendered immobile
and soon eaten, which is
a disturbing take on
""togetherness."""
810140,"Molten slimes are
capable of melting steel
and are predictably
found near volcanoes.
More surprising is their
distaste for group
behavior and yearning
for the wider world."
810141,"Those who wander beyond
the volcano are treated
to a world that invites
curiosity at every turn.
Alas, most things burn
to a crisp before the
molten slimes can get
close enough to touch."
810150,"It's everyone's favorite
friendly villager slime,
Mr. Flobby! You can find
him playing house or
racing against a girl in
the village, his bestest
friend forever."
810151,"Mr. Flobby comes from a
real big family! There's
his sister Plobby, his
brother Blebby, and his
nephew Booby! Sadly,
none of them are with us
any longer..."
810210,"Goblins love pranks by
nature and frequently
leap out in front of
adventurers they suspect
will make good
playmates. Sadly, this
tends to leave them
battered and bruised."
810211,"Goblins who gain the
wisdom of age find ways
to slip into the fabric
of human life. So yes,
that old man gamboling
with children in the
square might well be a
goblin in disguise!"
810220,"Activated by violence, umbral goblins relish using weapons that maim their enemies, and are said to be elated by the sound and sensation of cracking their enemies' bones."
810221,It seems incessant bullying from their supposed mates is what snapped these goblins. Perhaps humans are not the only ones preoccupied with fitting into society at large.
810310,"As these little fluffs
mature, their fur grows
until it covers their
faces. As this is quite
the existential threat,
they entice other
monsters to trim their
fur so they can see."
810311,"These creatures shed
rapidly as they age.
Upon losing the last of
their fur, they cry out
the remainder of their
bodily fluids, leaving
behind a nearly
mummified husk."
810320,"Revered among their
peers, these moody
furballs openly display
their contempt for the
world by dyeing their fur
red and donning
terrifying masks."
810321,"They are not your
average puffballs.
Adventurers, knowing
nothing of their pride,
hunt and make an
example of them with
each horrid kill."
810410,"Nary a soul has ever
laid eyes on a male
harpy, for they confine
themselves to the nest
and raise the young
while the females are
off hunting."
810411,"Poachers leave many a
male harpy's corpse in
their wake in pursuit of
baby harpy down, which
commands a high price in
illicit markets."
810420,"Spurned by their flock,
these wayward harpies
were struck by lightning
and imbued with magical
powers. Now white as
driven snow, they carry
themselves with a divine
air."
810421,"Though they longed to
return to the flock,
their radically altered
form led their own to
see them as enemies,
slashing until their
white feathers ran red
with blood."
810510,"Listen carefully in any
woodland and you’re
bound to hear the
methodical tap-tapping
of these little fellows’
wooden mallets. Monsters
consider them master
crafts-orcs."
810511,"Night after night the
orc children scour the
corpses of the monsters
they’ve killed,
searching for the raw
materials necessary to
make their next
instrument of death."
810520,"Orc wildlings are a
short-tempered lot who
heap scorn on any
creature weaker than
themselves. Most often
they can be found
attempting the theft of
money or equipment."
810521,"Wildlings frequently
spar in order to keep
their skills sharp.
Battles with no clear
winner reportedly
produce mutual respect
and enduring
friendships."
810610,"The careless manner with
which ogres brandish
their large stone axes
makes them very dangerous
indeed. Most monsters
flee the instant they
hear an ogre's
footfall."
810611,"Ogres spend their days
endlessly training deep
in their caves, lest
their compatriots mock
them for being too
scrawny."
810620,"These ogres subject
themselves to grueling
training, wearing heavy
chains such that they
may withstand even the
most grievous injuries
on the battlefield."
810621,"Ogres don't simply
withstand great pain in
battle—they delight in
it. Attacks are cause
for celebration,
typically the kind that
leave an area covered in
pools of blood."
810630,"Only the mighty Dragon
would not be
fear-stricken at the
sight of this beast. In
their wake lies a trail
of bounty hunters, each
blinded by visions of a
large bounty."
810631,"How strange that a
creature should fill its
days with combat and the
stench of blood soaking
into its hide when what
it truly desires is a
friend with whom to
share the solitude."
810710,"A powerful curse clings
to the bones of these
former humans, which pry
themselves from the
grave in search of
release. Dispel the
curse to render them a
pile of ordinary bones."
810711,"There once was a couple
consumed by an ill-fated
love, only to be
reunited in undeath. So
overjoyed were they at
their good fortune that
they both passed into a
sweet, eternal slumber."
810720,"Even in undeath these
warriors swear fealty to
their empire, clinging
to their swords and
shields, wandering in
endless pursuit of their
missing monarch."
810721,"They know now that their
ruler has perished.
Tormented by
inconsolable grief, they
have turned to an
afterlife of crime. None
remain who knew these
once-proud souls."
810730,"The religious scholars
knew if they were to
ascertain the true
nature of magic, they
would need immortality.
One lifetime was simply
too short."
810731,"Erelong, their pursuit
of eternal life made
monsters of them all.
Now, freed from
intellectual and
rational pursuits, they
invoke spells with what
sounds like pure joy."
810740,"With staggering magical
prowess theirs at last,
the lost souls regained
a modicum of humanity.
They gazed upon their
skeletal forms in
despair, and vowed to
become human once more."
810741,"No spell could return
the flesh to their
bones, though
experiments did yield a
way to reconnect with
loved ones. Any who
interfere with this
joyous rite are killed."
810810,"These demonic wolf
spirits travel in packs
the same way living
wolves do, though
mysteries abound—chief
among them, why these
creatures have no
heads."
810811,"Upon crossing into the
spirit realm,
wraithwolves allow their
packmates to slash their
necks; proof that they
shall never be tamed by
loathsome humans."
810820,"The flames engulfing
these wolves are said to
burn until the wolf
perishes. As such, one
nation took to engraving
the beasts on talismans,
as a symbol of long
life."
810821,"A pack of pyrowolves
lost in the forest risk
burning it all to the
ground. Keenly aware of
this, the forest
dwellers hunt the wolves
before they douse the
flames."
810830,"Ancient texts tell of a
creature quite similar
to this one. It seems
the ancients worshipped
them as ""keepers of the
lifelight."""
810831,"In recent years there
has been no end to the
number of adventurers
pursuing these wolves in
the hopes of capturing
one and never needing to
worry about light
again."
810910,"Long have the iron
tortoises hid within
their shells, tethered
to the earth. Now,
transformed at last,
they can take to the
skies with the wings
they have acquired."
810911,"Alas, wings have not
brought them courage.
They still retreat into
their shells when in
danger; so rare is their
flight that any who see
it are said to have good
luck for life."
810920,"One had best keep their
distance from these
tortoises, which nest in
volcanic areas and fire
jets of searing magma
from their shells."
810921,"Should one survive the
approach, stroking the
tortoise's head triggers
states of low, medium,
and high heat. Surely,
somewhere, a chef is
coveting this sentient
stove."
811020,"The miner's eternal foe.
Easily mistaken for any
old rock, one tap of
these with a pickaxe can
unleash a torrent of
pent-up laments
into the tunnels."
811021,"Miners are wont to gripe
as they are worked to
the bone, but the mines
have ears. Fearocks are
born of rocks that
absorb tens of thousands
of these idle
complaints."
811030,"All who lay eyes on
aquarocks are taken in
by their beauty, only
for the spirit within to
devour their souls in
service of further
polishing its vessel."
811031,"Their vessel polished,
the spirits pass on,
leaving behind a
gemstone frequently sold
in illicit markets.
Buyers are said to pay
what their life is worth
to own one."
811110,"These humanoid lizards
rarely hesitate to
attack, for they see
each and every passing
adventurer as an
opportunity to prove
themselves in battle."
811111,"During mating season
their belligerence
fades, and the males
turn their gaze upon the
females, flowers
clutched tightly in
hand. They are decidedly
stunted lovers."
811120,"Lizard warriors are
battle-hardened
creatures who thrill at
the thought of fighting
a powerful foe. Nigh
unshakable when armed."
811121,"The lizard warriors
shuffle home, their legs
and hearts heavy in
anticipation of the
unwinnable domestic
battles beyond the front
door."
811130,"Collectively these
decorated war veterans
have survived
countless battles, and
used the techniques
they've honed in combat
to fell many a renowned
adventurer."
811131,"Many captains visit the
graves of their late
wives between battles,
quietly awaiting their
next deployment. Someday
they shall be reunited;
until then, they fight."
811210,"Creatures of all sorts
flock to these gentle
giants of the forest, no
doubt thanks to the
pleasing warmth
emanating from the
energy stored within
their hollows."
811211,"Treants draw a steady
stream of energy from
the earth. So steady, in
fact, forests of these
animated trees have been
said to bleed the land
dry, leaving naught but
a barren waste."
811220,"Treants are the tender,
loving elders of the
forest; well versed in
the laws of nature yet
itinerant, never staying
in any one forest long
enough to put down
roots."
811221,"When treants cross paths
on their travels, they
each break off a branch
to graft on to one
another. Thus are the
memories in the rings of
each branch passed down
and preserved."
811230,"It is of utmost
importance that these
paragons of pestilence
be felled the moment
they are encountered,
for the plague they
spread does not fade
with their death."
811231,"Humanity first fouled
the woodlands, and among
the rotting trees and
sickened animals it was
the undead treants who
absorbed the plague and
purified the forests."
811310,"Dryads believe
themselves the belle of
the forest ball, so to
speak. On the night of
the full moon, they have
been known to hold
concerts deep in the
heart of the forest."
811311,"The mere hint of a
dryad's song is enough
to send creatures of the
forest fleeing, for
those who pay any mind
to it pass gently into
that good night."
811410,"Red fungos are fiercely
territorial, killing all
who set foot on their
land and turning the
corpses into red fungo
colonies. Forest
creatures fear their
swelling ranks."
811411,"Forest dwellers so covet
the red fungo as a
health food that they
leave monster carcasses
in the forest and return
to collect them once the
fungos have colonized
them."
811420,"Seeing as they produce
poison within their
bodies for protection,
these guys are anything
but fun. Factor in their
tough flesh and you have
a meal even the
omnivores avoid."
811421,"So many chefs have tried
and failed to come up
with a way to render
these creatures edible
that each new poisoning
elicits little more than
an eye roll from the
physician on duty."
811430,"Undead fungos with a
surfeit of poison in
their systems release a
scent meant to stimulate
a predator's appetite.
Said predators are all
too aware of this, and
thus steer clear."
811431,"Only the most desperate
humans eat undead
fungos, which cause
these poor souls to emit
shrieks in between bouts
of bloody vomiting.
Needless to say, they
perish."
811440,"The {CARDNAME:4010} makes his
escape with the help of
his stalwart guardian.
Why does our hero sense
some kind of grim
resolve from them as
they vanish over the
horizon...?"
811441,"{CARDNAME:51112}, in its most
diluted form, was a
curative to the humans.
It's no surprise, seeing
as it has the power to
transform whoever drinks
it into whatever form
they desire."
811450,"Born of the awesome
power of {CARDNAME:51112} and
the limitless hatred in
{CARDNAME:2030}'s heart,
this pale serpent would
see all existence erased
and the world born anew."
811451,"{CARDNAME:2030} wanted nothing
more than to see a world
he deemed filthy and
corrupt returned to a
blank slate. Whether
preventing his wish was
the right thing to do,
we will never know."
811460,"The {CARDNAME:4010} was tortured
by the Ivory Order for
so many moons that his
very existence had
passed into legend. His
accumulated resentment
is beyond human
comprehension."
811461,"And lo the {CARDNAME:4010}'s
malice took on a form
all its own, separate
from its mortal host.
If nothing else, it
should be given its
last rites..."

2040090,"From any cards left over, you can choose one to remain in your hand."
2040100,"This is the end of your turn. Next, I'll act for the other player."
2040110,I don't have any cards that can make a set. When that happens...
2040120,...you have to discard all but <highlight>one card</highlight> from your hand.
2040130,So that means I have to choose which ones to get rid of...
2040140,"Discarded cards go into the <highlight>pot</highlight>, which any player can use."
2040150,And that's the end of my turn. You're up again!

2040270,All right. Your turn.
2040280,"By the way, you can also make sets from <highlight>cards with consecutive numbers</highlight> on them."
2040290,But you can only make <highlight>one set</highlight> per turn.
2040300,"You can make a <highlight>two-card set with the 3s</highlight>, or a <highlight>three-card set of 2, 3, and 4</highlight>. Make whichever you prefer."
2040310,Remember what I told you about sets.
2040320,"You can make sets from <highlight>two or three cards of the same number</highlight>, or from <highlight>three consecutively numbered cards</highlight>."
2040330,But you can only make <highlight>one set per turn</highlight>.
2040340,And you can only have up to <highlight>three sets at a time</highlight>.
2040350,"When you make a fourth set, you'll have to discard one of the sets you already have."
2040360,That's it for the <highlight>basic rules</highlight>.
2040361,There are also rules that include additional things like <highlight>skill effects</highlight> and <highlight>events</highlight>. Be sure to give those a try.
2040370,There are no more cards in the deck. That means this is the last turn.
2040371,"Last but not least, let me explain the <highlight>menu screen</highlight>."
2040372,Bring up the menu with <highlight>{BUTTON@PLUS:sp_button-menu}</highlight>. There you can look at the <highlight>rulebook</highlight> or decide to <highlight>abandon the game</highlight>.
2040373,Bring up the menu with <highlight>{BUTTON@PLUS:sp_button-menu}</highlight>. There you can look at the <highlight>rulebook</highlight> or decide to <highlight>abandon the game</highlight>.
