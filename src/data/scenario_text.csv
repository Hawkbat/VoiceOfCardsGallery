10000001,
10000002,"Welcome to
<highlight>Voice of Cards</highlight>."
10000011,
10000012,You are about to take the first steps of your adventure.
10000021,
10000022,"Through a realm of sword and sorcery you will travel, battling bloodthirsty monsters as you strive to realize your <highlight>ambitions</highlight>."
10000031,
10000032,I have every faith you will accomplish great things here.
10000041,And You Are...?
10000042,I? I am merely a witness to your exploits.
10000051,Who Might You Be?
10000052,I? I am merely a witness to your exploits.
10000061,
10000062,"One last thing:
It's my job to read the cards out loud to you, so every now and then my voice will cut in."
10000071,
10000072,"But if you play with the volume off, you won't hear a word I say."
10000081,
10000082,"For the most immersive experience, I suggest either playing with either the volume or the subtitles on."
10000091,
10000092,"Would you like to display the subtitles?
Remember, you can always change these settings later in Options."
10000101,Display Subtitles
10000102,Subtitles will display.
10000111,Don't Display Subtitles
10000112,Subtitles will not display.
10000121,
10000122,"Remember, you can always change these settings later in Options."
10000131,
10000132,"Now then, your departure draws nigh. May your journey be a safe one..."
10000141,Dank Cave
10000142,We begin in a cave. The surrounding rocks are slimy with damp. It feels as if some foul creature could leap out from the shadows at any moment.
10000151,Dank Cave
10000152,Yet in this horrible place gathers a fellowship of three adventurers.
10000161,Young Woman
10000162,One is a young woman. You can tell just by looking at her she enjoyed a good upbringing.
10000171,Stern Man
10000172,"Another is a stoic warrior. He stands at the ready, scanning his surroundings for any sign of threat."
10000181,Ponderous Elder
10000182,"Last, but not least, is the old man. He has a sagely air, and gazes into the darkness stretching out before him."
10000191,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000192,These adventurers seek a certain <highlight>treasure</highlight> hidden in this cave.
10000201,Door
10000202,The adventurers cannot leave without finding that treasure.
10000211,A Heavy Door
10000212,An iron door towers before you. It has rather conspicuous handles.
10000221,A Heavy Door
10000222,What will you do?
10000231,Push the Door's Handle
10000232,"The stoic man takes hold of the handles and pushes as hard as he can...

But the door doesn't so much as budge."
10000241,Pull on the Door's Handle
10000242,"The stoic man takes hold of the handles and pulls as hard as he can...

But the door doesn't so much as budge."
10000251,Stern Man
10000252,The stoic man winds his leg back and lets fly a powerful kick into the door.
10000261,Heavy Door
10000262,"As his foot connects, the door trundles to the side. So it was one of those sliding contraptions..."
10000271,Dank Cave
10000272,Something leaps out at the fellowship from the darkness!
10000281,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000282,These adventurers have seen their fair share of battle and defeat their attackers with ease.
10000291,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000292,"As the trio approaches the treasure chest, an awful rumbling resounds deep in the cave..."
10000301,The Groan
10000302,"""You shall not have it,"" a voice growls."
10000311,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000312,Before the wary trio appear creatures the likes of which they've never seen.
10000321,Young Woman
10000322,The young woman edges around the monster's bulk to stand before the treasure chest.
10000331,Chest
10000332,"There is <highlight>treasure</highlight> inside, no doubt about it...but it's locked tight."
10000341,Chest
10000342,There's got to be some way of opening it.
10000351,Chest
10000352,The woman tries pouring medicine on the chest. I shouldn't have to explain why that doesn't work.
10000361,Chest
10000362,The woman withdraws a tool that looks nothing like a key. Spoilers: it doesn't open the lock.
10000371,Chest
10000372,The woman slides the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51002}</highlight> into the lock; the chest clicks open.
10000381,Chest
10000382,"His patience with the woman's antics exhausted, the old man uses the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51002}</highlight> to open the chest."
10000391,Medicine (?)
10000392,Inside is what appears for all the world to be an ordinary medicine bottle.
10000401,Ponderous Elder
10000402,"""At last we've retrieved the <highlight>royal treasure</highlight>,"" the old man says. The woman and warrior exchange a nod."
10000411,
10000412,The white-robed adventurers found the <highlight>royal treasure</highlight>!
10000421,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000422,"Their quest complete, the triumphant trio put the cave behind them."
10000431,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000432,"This is Castle Advent.
{CARDNAME:2010} reigns over the kingdom from within its walls."
10000441,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000442,"In the crowded audience chamber jostle all manner of knights, adventurers, and bounty hunters."
10000451,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000452,The white-robed adventurers stand close to the throne.
10000461,Royal Guard
10000462,"A palace guard calls over the tumult: ""Be silent. Her Royal Majesty graces us with her presence."""
10000471,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000472,The cacophony ceases the moment {CARDNAME:2010} enters the chamber.
10000481,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000482,"Seated upon the throne, the queen faces the crowd. Her lips part."
10000491,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000492,"""Thank you all for heeding my call to slay the {CARDNAME:4010}."""
10000501,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000502,"""Whatever it takes to defeat this reawakened evil, I ask that you do it."""
10000511,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000512,"""Whomsoever conquers this beast will be honored for ages to come and <highlight>handsomely rewarded</highlight>."""
10000521,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000522,"At that, the gathered crowd cheers loud enough to shake the castle's very foundations."
10000531,The White-Robed Adventurers
10000532,"""Leave the {CARDNAME:4010} to us, Your Majesty,"" say the white-robed adventurers, as if the beast's demise at their hands is assured."
10000541,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000542,"""Indeed, you did well to reclaim the <highlight>royal treasure</highlight>,"" the queen replies."
10000551,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000552,"""I thank you, for my stomach becomes most upset without it."" So the treasure is a staple of the royal medicine cabinet..."
10000561,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000562,"""It puts my mind at ease to know <highlight>the Ivory Order</highlight> offers its aid in slaying the {CARDNAME:4010}."""
10000571,The Ivory Order Trio
10000572,"The trio are disciples of <highlight>the Ivory Order</highlight>, a charitable organization beloved the realm over."
10000581,The Ivory Order Trio
10000582,"Indeed, anyone would think this illustrious trio the heroes of our tale."
10000591,The Ivory Order Trio
10000592,But they'd be wrong.
10000601,Strange Man
10000602,"""So we just gotta slay the {CARDNAME:4010} and we'll be drowning in gold..."" The man trails off, drooling over unknowable fantasies."
10000611,Strange Creature
10000612,Beside him a strange creature lets out a chirping coo.
10000621,Strange Man
10000622,"There he is—or, there you are, I should say—the <highlight>hero of our tale</highlight>."
10000631,Strange Man
10000632,"A humble bounty hunter, you love little in this realm more than coin."
10000641,Strange Man
10000642,"A seemingly tedious fellow who doesn't hesitate to claim the title of ""hero"" for yourself."
10000651,The Would-Be Hero
10000652,"When you heard about the quest to slay the {CARDNAME:4010}, it was the promise of reward that lured you to the castle."
10000661,Royal Guard
10000662,"""Now then, if you wish to officially register for the hunt, see me so I can get your signature."""
10000671,The Would-Be Hero
10000672,"You wonder why you need to sign anything, but head for the guard anyway."
10000681,Castle Advent Royal Hall
10000682,You haven't yet registered for the quest to slay the {CARDNAME:4010}. Go see the guard near the queen.  
10000691,The Ivory Order Trio
10000692,"The Ivory Order trio stands before you. They seem not the most approachable of parties, but..."
10000701,The Ivory Order Trio
10000702,Speak to the Ivory Order trio?
10000711,"Who Are You
Supposed to Be?"
10000712,"You inquire about their identities.

""We are disciples of the <highlight>Ivory Order</highlight>. It is our duty to aid the realm and its people however we can."""
10000721,I've Nothing to Say
10000722,"You don't think you have anything to say.

On second thought...
Yeah, you still don't."
10000731,The Ivory Order Trio
10000732,"""The Order's principal focus is developing medicine to distribute to people throughout the world..."""
10000741,The Ivory Order Trio
10000742,They begin blathering an answer to a question you didn't even ask.
10000751,The Would-Be Hero
10000752,"Sensing a long lecture ahead, you seize on the first chance to extricate yourself from their presence."
10000761,The Ivory Order Trio
10000762,"You try to speak to the trio again, but they're too involved in hashing out some sort of plan of attack to pay you any mind."
10000771,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000772,"You try to speak to {CARDNAME:2010}, but a guard blocks your path."
10000781,{CARDNAME:2010}
10000782,Figures a nobody bounty hunter can't just walk up to a queen and start chatting like they're best friends.
10000791,Royal Guard
10000792,"""Sign here,"" says the guard, handing you a pen and paper."
10000801,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10000851,That's Wrong
10000852,"For some reason or another, you've written your name incorrectly. Let's try this again..."
10000861,Royal Guard
10000862,"After you've signed, the guard motions to the strange creature beside you. ""The monster, too."""
10000871,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10000911,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10000921,Royal Guard
10000922,"""The {CARDNAME:4010}'s roar can scramble your brain, his claws can slice you clean in two, and one beat of his wings summons cyclones. It's what everyone says."""

10000932,"""Can't ask the dead what name to mark their grave with, after all."" The guard chortles."
10000941,Royal Guard
10000942,"The guard offers you one last piece of parting advice. ""Find some good people to help you fight the beast. You're less likely to die that way."""
10000951,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10000952,You want the reward as badly as you don't want to die. You figure you better make some strong friends.
10000961,The Ivory Order Trio
10000962,Offer to join forces with the Ivory Order trio?
10000971,"How About We
Do This Together?"
10000972,"""We select few are sufficient to defeat the {CARDNAME:4010}. We require no additional aid."""

10000991,The Ivory Order Trio
10000992,"""And we certainly don't require the aid of a no-name wastrel."" With that, the trio takes their leave of the castle."
10001001,{CARDNAME:2010}
10001002,Asking {CARDNAME:2010} to join you is...beyond preposterous. Better not even try.
10001011,Royal Guard
10001012,"""The castle will close to visitors shortly. Please be on your way."" You're shooed out of the castle."
10001021,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10001022,"You've yet to find any help for your quest. Things don't look that reassuring as they are, but the decision is up to you."
10001031,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10001032,Will you leave the hall?
10001041,Leave
10001042,You put the castle behind you.
10001051,Don't Leave
10001052,You stay in the castle a little longer to search for companions.

10001102,"The door is shut tight. You spy a keyhole on it, suggesting the existence of a corresponding key."

10001112,You turn the {CARDNAME:51110} in the lock...and the door opens!
10001121,Royal Guard
10001122,You sense a presence behind you and turn to see a guard. He starts talking to you like you're old friends.
10001131,Royal Guard
10001132,"He tells you this is where {CARDNAME:2010} used to store the royal treasure, but not anymore."
10001141,Royal Guard
10001142,"""So you see, you won't find anything of value in there,"" he finishes, and walks away."
10001151,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10001152,There's a scrap of paper on the ground where the guard was standing. You pick it up and read it.

10001252,"You whirl to the woman and shout, ""What are you doing!?"""
10001261,Mar! You All Right!?
10001262,You gather the dizzy {CARDNAME:1020} in your arms and glare at the woman.

10001311,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10001312,Inwardly you call her unsavory names as your attention shifts to a different topic of conversation.
10001321,Black-Clad Woman
10001322,"Turns out she really hates the {CARDNAME:4010}, and would love to take him down with her own two hands."
10001331,Black-Clad Woman
10001332,"But she knows she's no match for him alone, so she's at a loss for what to do."
10001341,Black-Clad Woman
10001342,"When you tell her you're after the same thing, she squints down her nose at you. ""Fine,"" she says. ""I can help you."""

10001392,That suits you perfectly. You happily join forces with the black-clad woman.
10001401,No Way!
10001402,"No way are you teaming up with someone who attacked you out of the blue, but as you open your mouth to tell her off..."

10001582,"According to him, the broader the face, the more handsome the man. Now that he mentions it, you do notice his face is a bit broader than most..."
10001591,Ivory Order Supporter
10001592,It seems the majority of the world's medicine is made by the Ivory Order. Many people depend on it.
10001601,Ivory Order Supporter
10001602,That's probably part of the reason the Order has so many ardent supporters.
10001611,
10001612,It seems you've learned all you can here. Time to move on.

10009342,An unspoken friendship begins to form between the two...or at least you hope that's what the prolonged silence between them means.

10009522,But {CARDNAME:1050} stops you and says he wants to journey with you just a little longer.
10009531,{CARDNAME:2090}
10009532,"But {CARDNAME:2090} is quick to douse the flames of his desire. ""You will stay here and study,"" he commands."

10009652,"""I don't get it,"" {CARDNAME:1040} remarks frankly."
10009661,{CARDNAME:1050}
10009662,"On the condition that he study nutrition upon his return, {CARDNAME:1050} is allowed to go with you for just a little while longer."

10009672,You realize that these two have a very special way of talking that no one else can understand...
10009681,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009682,"Hearing yet another roar in the distance, you realize you need to get the supplement to {CARDNAME:1020} so you can investigate the sound together."

10009741,{CARDNAME:1020}
10009742,{CARDNAME:1020} abruptly bolts up and turns his head toward you with a puzzled look.
10009751,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009752,It looks like {CARDNAME:1020} is all better now!
10009761,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009762,How do you express your joy?

10009832,{CARDNAME:1030} and {CARDNAME:1040} watch you two with a smile.
10009841,{CARDNAME:1050}
10009842,{CARDNAME:1050} is deeply moved to see nutrition bringing a smile to others.
10009851,

10009861,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10009862,"With this, you can finally put the happenings of that strange village behind you."

and Company"
10009872,"You decide to take {CARDNAME:1050} back to {CARDNAME:91070}, then continue your search for the {CARDNAME:4010}."
10009881,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009882,"You arrive at {CARDNAME:1050}'s house. Though he seems to want to adventure a little more, he reluctantly enters his house."
10009891,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009892,You ask {CARDNAME:2090} if he knows anything about the monster behind that mighty roar.
10009901,{CARDNAME:2090}
10009902,He says that the creature nests atop a <highlight>tower</highlight> not far from town.
10009911,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10009912,"With that, your next destination is decided. Here, you will part ways with these two, but you owe a great deal to the nutritionist and his son."
10009921,{CARDNAME:1050}
10009922,"{CARDNAME:1050} looks at you, his eyes begging you to let him come along. What will you say?"
10009931,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009932,How will you respond?
10009941,"Help Us Take
the Dragon Down"
10009942,"""Let us defeat the {CARDNAME:4010} together,"" you say to him."
10009951,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009952,You are sure his power and knowledge will come in handy against the beast.
10009961,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009962,"And, you realize with a grin, he will be so happy just to come along that he will not want a share of the reward..."
10009971,"Fare You Well,
Until We Meet Again"
10009972,"You know he would make a good ally, but you do not want to split the reward..."
10009981,{CARDNAME:1030}
10009982,"""Will you let him come if he doesn't ask for a share of the reward?"" {CARDNAME:1030} asks, seeing straight through your sleazy thoughts."
10009991,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10009992,"You nod. ""Yes, of course!"" What a quick change of heart!"
10010001,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010002,"{CARDNAME:1050} is happy he can continue the journey, but {CARDNAME:2090} stops him before he can get carried away."
10010011,{CARDNAME:2090}
10010012,"""You must stay here and study,"" {CARDNAME:2090} says."
10010021,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010022,{CARDNAME:1050} explains that the journey thus far has taught him the splendor of nutrition and he now wishes to travel the world to deepen his knowledge.
10010031,{CARDNAME:2090}
10010032,"After hearing his son out, {CARDNAME:2090} suddenly removes his glasses..."
10010041,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010042,"And in the blink of an eye, the flesh of {CARDNAME:1050}'s cheeks, pectorals, and abdomen recess..."
10010051,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010052,And {CARDNAME:1050} is lifted off his feet with a dull roar!
10010061,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010062,"Your eyes go wide at {CARDNAME:2090}'s assault, which was too fast for your eyes to catch."
10010071,{CARDNAME:2090}
10010072,"""Knowledge of nutrition can help save lives, but also strike down enemies,"" {CARDNAME:2090} says softly."
10010081,{CARDNAME:1040}
10010082,"""Wow, nutrition is incredible!"" {CARDNAME:1040} marvels, not putting too much thought into the events before her..."

10010092,"""Knowledge...is the true power."""

10010112,"Though {CARDNAME:2090} still deems his son's knowledge insufficient, he tells him to travel the world and surpass him someday."
10010121,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010122,"""Thank you, Father,"" {CARDNAME:1050} says from the ground, moved to tears by the strength of {CARDNAME:2090}'s knowledge."

10010132,So it comes to pass that you journey to the <highlight>tower</highlight> with {CARDNAME:1050} to find the roaring beast.

10010151,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010152,"""We have finally arrived at the tower of legend... Is everyone ready?"" you ask with a posed look."
10010161,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010162,"{CARDNAME:1050} is the first to respond. ""But this is just an old lighthouse,"" he remarks, oblivious to your sudden embarrassment."
10010171,{CARDNAME:1040}
10010172,"{CARDNAME:1040} snorts to herself, seeing you red in the face from jumping to conclusions."
10010181,Door
10010182,"It appears this sturdy door has a <highlight>magic seal</highlight> on it. Unfortunately, it is out of her realm of expertise..."

10010202,You all watch in silence as the door...stays shut.
10010211,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010212,"You snort to yourself, seeing {CARDNAME:1040} red in the face."

10010232,"You tried to fight magic with magic, only to have it repelled by the <highlight>seal</highlight>..."
10010241,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010242,"You consider breaking it down with a weapon, but decide against it given the possibility of a broken weapon and its repair costs..."
10010251,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010252,"Even {CARDNAME:1030} looks vexed, lacking the proper skills to open the door."
10010261,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010262,"{CARDNAME:1050} exhales deeply, then places both hands on the door. He pushes with all his might, his breath labored, chest heaving, sweat dribbling..."
10010271,Door
10010272,And it opens! It seems the <highlight>magic seal</highlight> could not protect the door from the physical might of your most stalwart companion!

and Company"
10010282,"""This is...the power...of power!"" {CARDNAME:1050} pants, but you promptly ignore him and enter the tower."

10010321,{CARDNAME:1040}
10010322,{CARDNAME:1040} has given up on thinking and whistles an offbeat melody to herself... You have made a poor choice.
10010331,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010332,{CARDNAME:1050} is admiring his own muscles gleaming in the torchlight... You have made a poor choice.
10010341,{CARDNAME:1030}

10010372,"You are instantly upon the shining object, picking it up."
10010381,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010382,{CARDNAME:1030} asks why you have such a fixation with money.

10010421,Dark Monster
10010422,"""Have you savages no mercy? The Dragon's heart and body have already been reduced to naught,"" it says."
10010431,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010432,"It sounds like he is saying something profound, but you do not understand it in the slightest."
10010441,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10010472,"{CARDNAME:1030} considers the words, but cannot seem to concentrate with the oppressive heat radiating from {CARDNAME:1050}'s sweltering pose."

10010522,"""Why are you so obsessed with defeating the {CARDNAME:4010}?"" you ask her."
10010531,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010532,She explains that her mother was killed by the {CARDNAME:4010}.
10010541,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010542,"She did not say any more, but her hatred for the beast was clear in her eyes."
10010551,Monstrous Howl
10010552,You hear the roar again. It seems to be coming from the upper levels.
10010561,{CARDNAME:1020}
10010562,"""Kyuu!"""
10010571,{CARDNAME:1020}
10010572,"{CARDNAME:1020} mewls, as if in response to the creature's growl."

10010602,It sounds like the roaring beast is close...
10010611,Heavy Door
10010612,"The door is shut tight. You spy a keyhole on it, suggesting the existence of a corresponding key."
10010621,Heavy Door
10010622,The door before you is shut quite tightly. It appears to have a keyhole... The <highlight>{CARDNAME:51110}</highlight> may be of use here.
10010631,Try the Key

10010711,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010712,You cross the threshold as if spurred forward by {CARDNAME:1030}'s...heartening words.
10010721,"The Would-Be Hero

10010722,You have finally arrived. Before you stands the <highlight>{CARDNAME:4010}</highlight> you have been searching for.

10010752,But the {CARDNAME:4010}'s roar sends your bravery flying with the wind.
10010761,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010762,その勇ましさに、君のことを少し見直した{CARDNAME:1030}が振り向くと……
10010771,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010772,Your legs tremble in fear...!
10010781,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010782,"But no matter how scared you are, the {CARDNAME:4010} will not wait."
10010791,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10010792,"""We shall strike you down!"" you exclaim, slashing out while cheering on your comrades. But at that moment..."
10010801,{CARDNAME:2040}
10010802,"{CARDNAME:2040} appears. Its wounds healed, the {CARDNAME:4010} looks more lively than before."
10010811,{CARDNAME:2040}
10010812,"""You, too, would be troubled without this {CARDNAME:4010},"" he says, standing in your way."
10010821,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010822,"""Stop spouting nonsense!"" the normally collected {CARDNAME:1030} shouts."
10010831,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010832,It seems {CARDNAME:1030} has lost her composure before her mother's killer. She unleashes a fireball imbued with her hatred...
10010841,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010842,But it is repelled by the {CARDNAME:4010}'s tough scales.
10010851,{CARDNAME:4010}
10010852,And the {CARDNAME:4010} returns the favor by spewing fire from its mouth!
10010861,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010862,You seem to stand no chance against the revitalized {CARDNAME:4010}. {CARDNAME:1030} looks distressed...
10010871,{CARDNAME:4010}
10010872,{CARDNAME:2040} climbs atop the beast's back. The flapping of the {CARDNAME:4010}'s wings sends forth one windblast after the next.
10010881,{CARDNAME:2040}
10010882,"""Stay out of this,"" {CARDNAME:2040} commands, then flies off toward the western sea."
10010891,{CARDNAME:1030}
10010892,"You worry for {CARDNAME:1030} who has been burnt badly by the {CARDNAME:4010}'s fire. ""I can't...get up..."" she whispers weakly."
10010901,{CARDNAME:1050}
10010902,"""Drink this,"" {CARDNAME:1050} instructs, offering her a small bottle, ""It will help you regain your strength."""

10010931,"If Anything,
I Should Take It!"

As you reach out your hand to take it for yourself..."

10010942,...{CARDNAME:1040} slaps you so hard your teeth nearly fly out.
10010951,"Make Her Take It,
and Quick!"
10010952,"""Make her drink it already!"" you cry, your panicked expression urging {CARDNAME:1050} to give {CARDNAME:1030} the supplement."

10011021,{CARDNAME:2090}
10011022,"When you return, {CARDNAME:2090} approaches. It seems like something has happened to the town."
10011031,{CARDNAME:2090}
10011032,He says a raging wind blew through and destroyed the town. You surmise the flapping of the {CARDNAME:4010}'s wings is to blame.
10011041,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011042,"You explain that you need a boat to go after the {CARDNAME:4010}, and {CARDNAME:2090}'s look turns grim."

10011082,"Your brows furrow, knowing that there is no way you could move a ship..."
10011091,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011092,"Beside you, {CARDNAME:1050} stretches, warming up his body."

10011102,"After striking a fantastic pose to show off his muscles, he charges straight at the boat."
10011111,{CARDNAME:1050}

10011142,"""Now it's working!"" {CARDNAME:1050} exclaims, unsurprised at the sight of {CARDNAME:1030}."
10011151,Swole Melanie
10011152,It appears the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51116}</highlight> she drank in the tower bulked her up.
10011161,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011162,"""Let us combine our power!"" {CARDNAME:1050} entreats {CARDNAME:1030}."

10011181,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011182,You need {CARDNAME:1030}'s help to catch the {CARDNAME:4010}. You call out to her.

10011192,What do you say to her?
10011201,Lend Me Your Strength!
10011202,"You turn your earnest eyes to her and say, ""Please, lend us your strength!"""
10011211,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011212,"...But, unable to hold back at the sight of her impressive build, burst into laughter."
10011221,Atta Burly Girl!
10011222,"Hoping to distract her from her shame, you shout out complete nonsense!"
10011231,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011232,"But in the next instant, you receive a violent punch to the face and are sent flying."

10011282,"At any rate, you leave the port town and follow the {CARDNAME:4010}."
10011291,
10011292,How about finally boarding the boat and going after the {CARDNAME:4010}?
10011301,Set Sail!
10011302,"Just as you are about to leave, {CARDNAME:2090} comes to see you off. It looks like he has something to say."
10011311,{CARDNAME:2090}
10011312,"According to him, the {CARDNAME:4010} flew to the west where there is an island called <highlight>Mt. Medica</highlight>."
10011321,{CARDNAME:2090}
10011322,Rumor has it they are actively researching medicine on this island. He thinks he can use their knowledge in his work.
10011331,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011332,"Understanding his father's wishes, {CARDNAME:1050} nods, ""Say no more."""

Something stirs deep inside your chest, but you blame your imagination and board the boat without another thought."

10011352,息子兼弟子に経験を積ませるため、「{CARDNAME:1050}を君達に同行させてほしい」と{CARDNAME:2090}から頼まれた。
10011361,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011362,{CARDNAME:1050}の同行を許すか？
10011371,いいだろう
10011372,君は「賞金の分け前は渡さない」という条件付きで、同行を承諾した。
10011381,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011382,"「よろしくな！」と、{CARDNAME:1050}が君の手を握る。
こちらの手が潰れるかと思うほど痛い……"
10011391,暑苦しいのは勘弁
10011392,"君が「やだよ暑苦しい」と断ろうとすると……
{CARDNAME:1050}に友好の証のヘッドロックをかまされた。"
10011401,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011402,{CARDNAME:1050}は君達のことが気に入ったらしく「ぜひ同行させてほしい」という。
10011411,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011412,君は息ができず朦朧とする中で、気付いたら{CARDNAME:1050}の同行を承諾していた……
10011421,"I Still Have
Preparations to Make"
10011422,You will be sailing after the {CARDNAME:4010}. Make sure you are prepared for the journey.
10011431,{CARDNAME:1040}
10011432,"""Wasn't that SO much fun!?"" {CARDNAME:1040} can hardly contain her excitement as she seeks a similar reaction from {CARDNAME:1030}."
10011441,{CARDNAME:1030}
10011442,"""Sure,"" {CARDNAME:1030} croaks, her face a sickly shade of green. The <highlight>{CARDNAME:51116}</highlight> has worn off completely."
10011451,{CARDNAME:1040}
10011452,"{CARDNAME:1040} turns to you and carries on, oblivious. ""Wasn't that just the greatest!?"""
10011461,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011462,"You, however, are a bit worn out, as your mid-voyage teasing of {CARDNAME:1030} prompted her to wring you like a rag."
10011471,
10011472,"Your first order of business should be a sweep of the island to ascertain the {CARDNAME:4010}'s whereabouts. Tread carefully, as danger lies in the unknown."
10011481,
10011482,"A road stretches west from the docks, suggesting the presence of a house or settlement at the other end."
10011491,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011492,"You take the lead, taking in the island's scenery. It all looks unsettlingly familiar to you."
10011501,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011502,"A white-hot streak of pain shoots through your head, feeling as though your skull will split in two. You grab your head as if holding it together, and drop to your knees."
10011511,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011512,The searing pain erases any hope of recalling the memory that felt primed to return to you.
10011521,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011522,"Beads of sweat are pouring off you now as you struggle to keep your head in one piece. ""Drink this,"" {CARDNAME:1050} insists, offering you a bottle of headache curative."
10011531,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011532,"You greedily drink it down, desperate for relief. The pain begins to ebb, and you hurriedly resolve to press on."
10011541,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011542,"After a time, you happen upon a village. ""This place..."" you mutter unconsciously."
10011551,{CARDNAME:1020}
10011552,"Mar coos softly, but doesn't quite sound himself."
10011561,{CARDNAME:1020}
10011562,Perhaps he is as anxious as you are about this place.
10011571,{CARDNAME:1030}
10011572,"""You two okay?"" {CARDNAME:1030} asks. You open your mouth to reply..."
10011581,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011582,Only to notice the ambush a moment too late. Repel the monster attack!
10011591,Giant Boulder
10011592,"Large boulders block the path before you. Alas, you must turn back."
10011601,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011602,The ship stands ready to set sail. What will you do?
10011611,"Take the Ship
Back to Land"
10011612,You board a boat and chart a course back to the mainland.
10011621,Don't Board the Ship
10011622,You have unfinished business. The mainland can wait.
10011631,Villager
10011632,"You are accosted by a man the instant you set foot in the village.
""Medicine...please!"" he begs."
10011641,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011642,His eyes are glazed over and his general demeanor unsettling. Should he really have medicine?
10011651,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011652,Will you give him what he desires?
10011661,"Hand Over
the Medicine"
10011662,"You give him a glimpse of the medicine. ""Nothing in this life is free,"" you sneer."
10011671,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011672,Your callousness is swiftly punished as the medicine slips from your grasp and clatters to the ground.
10011681,"Don’t Hand Over
the Medicine"
10011682,"You start to refuse, only to see {CARDNAME:1030}'s arm reach past you, medicine in hand. ""Here you go,"" she says sweetly."
10011691,Villager
10011692,"The man runs off to who-knows-where, making noises that can only be described as inhuman."
10011701,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10011702,"You and the party resolve to continue exploring the village, despite the unsettling encounter that just occurred."
10011711,
10011712,Something is askew in this village. It would be best to proceed with caution until you can determine what is happening.
10011721,
10011722,You cannot use the <highlight>jump feature</highlight> here.
10011731,Villager
10011732,"Another villager approaches you. Though his speech is slurred, the demand remains the same: medicine."
10011741,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011742,This villager is also behaving strangely. Will you acquiesce to his request?
10011751,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011752,Hand the villager medicine?
10011761,"Hand Over
the Medicine"
10011762,"{CARDNAME:1040} briefly reveals the medicine under her cloak. ""Nothing in life is free..."" she says, clearly mocking your earlier blunder."
10011771,{CARDNAME:1040}
10011772,"Her fun is short-lived as she, too, loses her grip on the medicine. Karma is cruel and indiscriminate."
10011781,"Don’t Hand Over
the Medicine"
10011782,"You remove the medicine from your pack, recall for a moment how much it cost, and begin sliding it back into place..."
10011791,Villager
10011792,"In the blink of an eye, the villager snatches up the medicine bottle and darts out of view."
10011801,Villager
10011802,"You could not help but notice the groans of ""Medicine...sweet medicine!"" as he fled."
10011811,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011812,"""Something's not right in this village,"" {CARDNAME:1050} mutters, clearly worried."
10011821,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011822,"You hear a panicked cry up the road. ""Stay with me! Focus on me!""

That can't be good."
10011831,Villager
10011832,"You arrive on the scene to find a man collapsed in the street, convulsing. Another man kneels over him in an apparent attempt to provide comfort and care."
10011841,White Knight
10011842,The noble man wears impressive white armor befitting a knight. He continues talking to the fallen man as he provides emergency care.
10011851,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011852,Seeing the knight's devotion makes you feel a bit like a putz for doing nothing.
10011861,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011862,What will you do?
10011871,"Offer the Villager
Medicine"
10011872,"The villager is in quite a state. In a rare move, you volunteer some medicine with no strings attached."
10011881,White Knight
10011882,"""He'll have none of that!"" the knight barks, stopping you cold."
10011891,"Offer the Villager
a {CARDNAME:51116}"
10011892,You ask {CARDNAME:1050} to provide some of his <highlight>{CARDNAME:51116}</highlight>.
10011901,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011902,He furrows his brow and solemnly shakes his head.
10011911,Villager
10011912,"The villager is now clawing at his own face with his fingernails, crying out for medicine."
10011921,Villager
10011922,"Blood as black as tar begins oozing out of his eyes, ears, and mouth. It proceeds to leak from every orifice imaginable."
10011931,Villager
10011932,"The convulsions subside. Within moments, the villager lies still."
10011941,
10011942,A horrific thought makes itself known: this is the first time you have witnessed the <highlight>death</highlight> of a fellow man.
10011951,
10011952,"Even in a world where medicines and elixirs can cure most any ailment, none are safe from death's icy grip."
10011961,
10011962,"And as well you know...

That which is dead can never return."
10011971,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10011972,Your mind goes blank. You drop to your knees in shock.
10011981,Your Friends
10011982,"{CARDNAME:1030} clamps her hand to her mouth, stifling a scream. {CARDNAME:1040} shakes uncontrollably."
10011991,{CARDNAME:1050}
10011992,"The knight hangs his head. {CARDNAME:1050} nervously asks, ""What are you doing here?"""
10012001,White Knight
10012002,The knight's name is {CARDNAME:2030}. He identifies himself as a member of the Ivory Order.
10012011,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012012,"His travels brought him to this village, where he has been caring for the ailing residents."
10012021,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012022,"His face contorts in disgust. ""If not for these foul drugs, they would be healed!"" he spits, and takes his leave."
10012031,{CARDNAME:1050}
10012032,{CARDNAME:1050} gazes upon the villager's corpse with a look of apparent realization...
10012041,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012042,"You approach {CARDNAME:2030}, who is caring for another villager. ""Is every day like this?"" you inquire."
10012051,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012052,"According to the knight, an elderly man living just outside the village is typically the one who looks after its residents."
10012061,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012062,"""You'd be best served asking him all your questions,"" {CARDNAME:2030} says as he returns to his patient."
10012071,Injured Man
10012072,"You hail the villager, only to receive a blunt, ""Go bother the village headman with your chatter!"" in return."
10012081,Injured Man
10012082,The villager turns to face the wall once more and smacks his head against it repeatedly. His forehead is soon covered in blood...
10012091,Medicine Lover
10012092,"You ask the villager about the {CARDNAME:4010}. ""The headman can help you if you're in some trouble,"" she retorts, doubling over to empty the contents of her stomach onto the street."
10012101,Medicine Lover
10012102,Dozens of empty medicine bottles litter the ground in front of this woman.
10012111,Abandoned House
10012112,There isn't a soul about. The house is surely abandoned.
10012121,Suspicious Old Man
10012122,"You knock lightly on the door. An elderly man opens it, beaming at you."
10012131,Suspicious Old Man
10012132,He announces himself as {CARDNAME:2100} and beckons you inside. Might he be the headman you've heard so much about?
10012141,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012142,"""Ask me anything you like,"" he offers. {CARDNAME:2100} receives your party, for whatever reason, rather graciously."
10012151,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012152,He could well be a font of knowledge. What will you ask him?
10012161,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012162,What will you ask?
10012171,"Have You Seen
the Dragon?"
10012172,You ask if he has seen the {CARDNAME:4010}.
10012181,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012182,"""Why yes,"" he says. ""He <highlight>returned to this island</highlight> just the other day!"""
10012191,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012192,"""Oh, but don't worry,"" he continues, ""He hasn't caused us too much trouble.""
Needless to say, this does not comport with your understanding of the {CARDNAME:4010}."
10012201,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012202,"You notice {CARDNAME:1030} lift an eyebrow at his use of the word ""returned."""
10012211,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012212,"At any rate, the {CARDNAME:4010}'s presence on the island is confirmed. You quietly celebrate the first credible lead you've yet received."
10012221,"Why Does
This Place Feel...Off?"
10012222,You make mention of the village's...eccentricities.
10012231,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012232,{CARDNAME:2100} informs you that the island indeed suffers from an extreme shortage of medicine.
10012241,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012242,"He apologizes for the villagers' incivility.
""Consider it the price to pay for making the world a better place,"" he adds, nonsensically."
10012251,You the Headman?
10012252,You ask if he is the one in charge of the village.
10012261,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012262,"It's true that the villagers call him their headman. ""But I feel compelled to correct the record and state that my official title is <highlight>overseer</highlight>."""
10012271,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10012272,"Your questions satisfactorily answered, you thank {CARDNAME:2100} and turn to leave."
10012281,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012282,"He asks you to stop. ""We have yet to discuss the terms of your living here,"" he declares."
10012291,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012292,How will you respond?
10012301,"I Ain't Putting Down
Roots Here"
10012302,You explain that you are only here to pursue the {CARDNAME:4010} and have no intention to stay.
10012311,"I Have to Go After
the Dragon"
10012312,You explain that you are only here to pursue the {CARDNAME:4010} and have no intention to stay.
10012321,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012322,{CARDNAME:2100} begs your forgiveness for thinking you were <highlight>newcomers</highlight>.
10012331,{CARDNAME:2100}
10012332,"""It's perfectly understandable though, what with the <highlight>nonmatch</highlight> among you,"" he says with a sneer."
10012341,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012342,"""What does he mean by that?"" {CARDNAME:1030} asks you, unable to grasp the old man's intentions."
10012351,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012352,"For reasons unknown, you feel the blood drain from your face. Your breathing grows ragged and you break out in a sweat."
10012361,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012362,"""We're done here,"" you say defiantly as you storm out of the house."
10012371,{CARDNAME:1020}
10012372,"{CARDNAME:1020} runs after you, chirping frantically."
10012381,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012382,"{CARDNAME:1030} and the others give chase, but you and {CARDNAME:1020} are well out of sight by the time they make it outside."
10012391,
10012392,{CHARACTERNAME:1010} and {CARDNAME:1020} have left the party.
10012401,
10012402,{CARDNAME:1030} is now the party leader.
10012411,
10012412,"The two can't have gone far, though.
It may be best to first search the village."
10012421,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012422,"""We have to find the others first,"" {CARDNAME:1030} insists."
10012431,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012432,{CARDNAME:2030} is still tending to the villagers' needs. {CARDNAME:1030} explains the sudden disappearance of her allies.
10012441,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012442,"""They ran down the <highlight>road leading west</highlight>,"" {CARDNAME:2030} says calmly."
10012451,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012452,{CARDNAME:2030} pays you no mind as he tends to the villagers. Perhaps it would be best to take him at his word and search the <highlight>road leading west</highlight>.
10012461,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012462,{CARDNAME:1030} and company find you standing in front of a house.
10012471,The Two Loiterers
10012472,"She can't quite make it out, but it sounds as though you're saying to {CARDNAME:1020}, ""This place is..."""
10012481,{CHARACTERNAME:1010} and {CARDNAME:1030}
10012482,"{CARDNAME:1030} calls out to you, prompting you to blurt out, ""Er, sorry, just had a bad stomachache back there!"" in your characteristically glib manner."
10012491,{CARDNAME:1020}
10012492,{CARDNAME:1020} chirps skeptically.
10012501,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012502,{CARDNAME:1030} opens her mouth to speak...
10012511,"Are You Sure
You're All Right?"
10012512,"She surveys you both, and sees two haggard travelers unwilling to admit they're in need.

""Are you sure you're all right?"" she asks, concerned."
10012521,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012522,"""Fine, absolutely fine!"" you tell her, perhaps too eagerly."
10012531,"Guess I Shouldn't
Have Worried"
10012532,"""I don't know why I bother worrying about you,"" she lets slip."
10012541,{CHARACTERNAME:1010} and {CARDNAME:1030}
10012542,"""So you WERE worried about me,"" you shoot back.
""No I wasn't,"" she replies, her face reddening."
10012551,
10012552,{CHARACTERNAME:1010} and {CARDNAME:1020} rejoin the party.
10012561,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012562,You spot a familiar-looking mage on the village streets.
10012571,{CARDNAME:1110}
10012572,{CARDNAME:1110} takes no notice of you and ducks into the <highlight>{CARDNAME:103012}</highlight>.
10012581,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012582,"""So, the Ivory Order buys their medicine just like everybody else,"" you muse to yourself as you prick up your ears and listen carefully."
10012591,"Wynifred and
the Apothecary"
10012592,"{CARDNAME:1110} and the apothecary speak in hushed tones.
You'd guess it's an order for <highlight>special medicine</highlight>, but you can't make it out."
10012601,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012602,"Alas, she's just buying the usual stuff. Nothing remotely interesting about that."
10012611,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012612,Though her presence suggests that other members of the Order might also be in town...
10012621,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012622,"With no desire to run into them, you make yourself scarce before she catches sight of you."
10012631,
10012632,{CARDNAME:2100} doesn't appear to be home right now.
10012641,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012642,You spy the very people you were hoping to avoid gathered near the village gate.
10012651,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012652,"""The last thing we need is a confrontation,"" you mutter, spying them from the shadows."
10012661,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012662,"""Why are we always hiding?"" {CARDNAME:1030} hisses under her breath."
10012671,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012672,Two members of the Order are speaking with {CARDNAME:2030}.
10012681,The Ivory Order Duo
10012682,"Given how deferential they appear to be acting toward him, you hazard a guess that he's their superior."
10012691,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012692,"""Have you determined the {CARDNAME:4010}'s location?"" {CARDNAME:2030} asks. {CARDNAME:1130} launches into his report."
10012701,{CARDNAME:1130}
10012702,"""The {CARDNAME:4010} appears to be occupying the <highlight>{CARDNAME:92070}</highlight>. I suggest we move to capture him immediately,"" he counsels."
10012711,{CARDNAME:1110}
10012712,"Now who should appear but {CARDNAME:1110}, fresh from her shopping excursion."
10012721,{CARDNAME:1110}
10012722,"""Preparations for our journey into the {CARDNAME:92070} are complete,"" she reports, handing {CARDNAME:2030} a bottle of...something."
10012731,{CARDNAME:2030}
10012732,"""Splendid."" {CARDNAME:2030} walks off and out of sight, the other three following close behind."
10012741,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012742,"Lucky for you, your hastily improvised hiding spot afforded you valuable information on the {CARDNAME:4010}."
10012751,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012752,Yet their conversation raised as many questions as it answered...
10012761,"How Do We Get
to the Volcano?"
10012762,"You know that the {CARDNAME:4010} is lurking in the {CARDNAME:92070}, but you haven't a clue how to get from here to there."
10012771,"How Do We Get
to the Volcano?"
10012772,"You know that the {CARDNAME:4010} is lurking in the {CARDNAME:92070}, but can't for the life of you recall how to get there from here."
10012781,{CARDNAME:1040}
10012782,"""Isn't it that mountain with all the smoke pouring out of it?"" {CARDNAME:1040} asks, pointing westward. Why yes, that sure does look rather like a {CARDNAME:92070}."
10012791,"What About That
Medicine Bottle?"
10012792,The medicine bottle {CARDNAME:2030} received is probably related to their journey into the {CARDNAME:92070} somehow...
10012801,{CARDNAME:1050}
10012802,"{CARDNAME:1050} recalls seeing a bottle much like it once before. He says it contains <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight>, which can chill most anything."
10012811,{CARDNAME:1050}
10012812,"""Maybe that's what {CARDNAME:1110} bought at the {CARDNAME:103012},"" {CARDNAME:1050} continues."
10012821,Capture the Dragon?
10012822,There was talk of capturing the {CARDNAME:4010}.
10012831,{CARDNAME:1030}
10012832,"{CARDNAME:1030} picked up on the incongruity as well. ""The queen ordered the {CARDNAME:4010} killed,"" she reminds you."
10012841,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012842,"You narrow your eyes. ""You three have no right being this helpful,"" you think."
10012851,{CARDNAME:1020}
10012852,"{CARDNAME:1020} pinches your cheeks without warning. You yelp in pain, which at the very least crosses ""dreaming"" off the list of explanations."
10012861,
10012862,"Returning to the matter at hand, it's clear what must be done: You'll have to get your hands on some <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight> if you hope to enter the {CARDNAME:92070}."
10012871,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012872,"""Happen to have any <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight> for sale?"" you cheerily ask the apothecary."
10012881,Apothecary
10012882,"She flashes a wry smile. ""How do you steady the roiling magma's flow?"" she asks cryptically."
10012891,{CHARACTERNAME:1010} and {CARDNAME:1030}
10012892,"The meaning behind the question is utterly lost on you.
""She needs a password!"" {CARDNAME:1030} mutters over your shoulder."
10012901,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012902,"The answer, then, would be the password. So, ""How do you steady the roiling magma's flow?"""
10012911,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012912,The password is...
10012921,Cold Ice
10012922,"""Ah yes, yes, you'd think so,"" she says, as if turning the answer over in her mind.

""But you'd be wrong."""
10012931,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012932,"She pulls out her wares, but what you need is not among them. Your password merely granted you entry to the apothecary."
10012941,Flowing Water
10012942,"""Mhm, mhm,"" she mutters softly.

""Alas, no."""
10012951,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10012952,"She pulls out her wares, but what you need is not among them. Your password merely granted you entry to the apothecary."
10012961,Special Medicine
10012962,"The old woman rolls her eyes, suddenly looking defeated.

""How did you know the answer? Did someone tell you?"" she mutters bitterly."
10012971,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10012972,"You've managed to crack the code, and a bottle of <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight> is yours.
At last, you are ready to enter the {CARDNAME:92070}."
10012981,Raconteur
10012982,"A man approaches you as you wander through the village. ""Spare a bit of medicine?"" he asks genially."
10012991,Raconteur
10012992,He sets about convincing you that your kindness will be returned tenfold if you just give him a little from your pack. His silver tongue would put even the best salesman to shame.
10013001,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013002,"You reach for a bottle of medicine, completely taken in by his pitch. {CARDNAME:1050} stills your hand. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you."""
10013011,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013012,Should you give him what he wants?
10013021,"Listen to the Villager
a Little More"
10013022,"""Why do you want it so badly?"" you ask, affording him another opening. He gladly takes it."
10013031,Raconteur
10013032,"He first came in contact with it as a child. His parents paid him no mind, and so he spent his days on the banks of the river, skipping stones all by his lonesome."
10013041,Raconteur
10013042,One day a girl approached him and invited him to play with her. Moments later they were locked in a heated battle to see how many consecutive skips they could get.
10013051,Raconteur
10013052,"Before they knew it, the sun hung low in the sky. Exhausted from their competition, they said their goodbyes and made for home. She won an overwhelming victory—seven skips in a row."
10013061,Raconteur
10013062,"From that day on, they would play by the river together whenever they had the chance. His time with her was sacred, seeing as his parents hardly noticed him at home."
10013071,Raconteur
10013072,"But it didn't last. He arrived at the river only for her words to cut him open: ""I can't play with you anymore."" Her parents were moving to a new town to start a new job."
10013081,Raconteur
10013082,"She thanked him for playing with her all those many days, said she was sorry, and handed him a gift. They exchanged their final goodbyes, and parted ways."
10013091,Raconteur
10013092,He placed the gift on a table when he got home. Next to where he set the gift happened to be a bottle of medicine. He took a sip and never since forgot its wonderful taste.
10013101,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013102,"You are fully invested in this story and desperate to give the man some small comfort in this cruel, cruel world. You're primed and ready to hand it over."
10013111,{CARDNAME:1030}
10013112,"""I've heard better sob stories,"" {CARDNAME:1030} says dryly, having somehow absorbed the man's story despite the blistering speed in which he delivered it."
10013121,"Hurry Onward without
Handing Over the Medicine"
10013122,"""I really shouldn't!"" you yelp over your shoulder, already walking away at a brisk pace."
10013131,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013132,"You continue wandering the village streets, only to be accosted by the man once more. It seems he will follow you to the ends of the earth..."
10013141,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013142,"{CARDNAME:1050} thinks you'd better not, but you're not so sure."
10013151,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013152,Will you give the man what he wants?
10013161,"Hand Over
the Medicine"
10013162,"The man smiles deliriously as he watches the bottle enter his outstretched hand. Not one moment later, he is gone."
10013171,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013172,He appears to have dropped something peculiar in his haste...
10013181,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013182,He's dropped something in his haste...
10013191,
10013192,You pick up <highlight>{CARDNAME:70008}</highlight>!
10013201,"Don’t Hand Over
the Medicine"
10013202,You heed {CARDNAME:1050}'s warning and return the medicine to your pack.
10013211,Raconteur
10013212,"The man's shoulders droop, and he shuffles off out of sight."
10013221,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013222,He appears to have dropped something peculiar in his haste...
10013231,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013232,He's dropped something in his haste...
10013241,
10013242,You pick up <highlight>{CARDNAME:70008}</highlight>!
10013251,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013252,"Superheated air unlike any you've experienced assaults you from all sides. ""It's too hot!"" you whine within seconds."
10013261,{CARDNAME:1030}
10013262,"""It's...not that bad,"" {CARDNAME:1030} says coolly, her sweat-soaked face telling you she is absolutely lying."
10013271,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10013272,You won't survive this journey with your current equipment. Best to make a quick exit.
10013281,
10013282,
10013291,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013292,The heat of the {CARDNAME:92070} engulfs you the moment you set foot inside.
10013301,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013302,"Of course the {CARDNAME:4010} is hiding out here. Guess it's as good a place as any to corner him, you reason with yourself, trying to keep your spirits up."
10013311,Lava River
10013312,Crossing this river of lava won't be easy.
10013321,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013322,Do you know a way to cross?
10013331,I Do
10013332,"""Here's how you cross a lava river! BAM!"""
10013341,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013342,"You open the bottle of {CARDNAME:51111} and pour some into the raging river of lava.
The lava instantly hardens, forming a bridge of rock!"
10013351,I Do
10013352,"""Here's how you cross a lava river! BAM!"""
10013361,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013362,"You aimlessly toss junk you've deemed unnecessary into the lava. The flow of time, as well as the river, continues unabated."
10013371,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013372,"Perhaps <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight> is enough of a hint for how to move forward?
You resolve to return once you have some <highlight>{CARDNAME:51111}</highlight> in hand."
10013381,"We'll Come Back
Another Time"
10013382,"After giving it some thought, you figure you'll try again later and turn back."
10013391,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013392,"You can't help but chant, ""It's hot... SO hot,"" every couple of steps, as if conjuring a spell."
10013401,{CARDNAME:1030}
10013402,"""You're just wasting energy,"" {CARDNAME:1030} chides.
Perhaps you could stand to learn a thing or two from her rational approach."
10013411,{CARDNAME:1050}
10013412,"{CARDNAME:1050} seizes on the moment. ""Yeah, this isn't even worth whining over,"" he says, flexing at you."
10013421,{CARDNAME:1030}
10013422,"""It is WAY TOO HOT FOR THIS!"" {CARDNAME:1030} screams, forgetting her own advice."
10013431,
10013432,<highlight>{CARDNAME:70009}</highlight> acquired!
10013441,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013442,A clump of familiar white outfits comes into view. You've caught up with the Ivory Order at last!
10013451,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013452,"""We shall be the ones to fell the {CARDNAME:4010}!"" you proclaim loudly to...no one, apparently, for the Order pays you no mind."
10013461,{CARDNAME:1110}
10013462,"At your persistence, {CARDNAME:1110} requests, ""Please do not interfere with the {CARDNAME:4010}'s capture,"" clearly annoyed."
10013471,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013472,"As you all suspected, they have no intention of following the queen's orders to slay the {CARDNAME:4010}."
10013481,{CARDNAME:1030}
10013482,"""What will you do with him once he is yours?"" {CARDNAME:1030} asks forcefully."
10013491,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013492,"But her answer shall have to wait! The lava bubbles and swirls as monsters leap out onto the rock before you!
It would seem the only way out is through!"
10013501,{CARDNAME:2030}
10013502,"In a flash, {CARDNAME:2030}'s blade cleaves one in two."
10013511,{CARDNAME:2030}
10013512,"Clearly, he has earned his rank within the Order."
10013521,{CARDNAME:2030}
10013522,"""Keep moving!"" he bellows, leading his companions deeper into the {CARDNAME:92070}."
10013531,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013532,"The remaining monster turns toward you, eager to avenge its fallen friend.
There shall be no avoiding this battle!"
10013541,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013542,"You escape with your lives, but the Ivory Order has put some distance between you."
10013551,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013552,"All your efforts will be for naught if they reach the {CARDNAME:4010} before you do.
You hurry the party onward."
10013561,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10013562,"A deafening roar greets you as you set foot on the summit.
The {CARDNAME:4010} must be close!"
10013571,"The Ivory Order Trio
and the Dragon"
10013572,You reach the caldera only to find the {CARDNAME:4010} and the Ivory Order members locked in battle!
10013581,"The Ivory Order Trio
and the Dragon"
10013582,Their teamwork is impeccable. With each strike they drive the {CARDNAME:4010} further back.
10013591,{CARDNAME:2040}
10013592,"{CARDNAME:2040} is doing everything he can to protect the {CARDNAME:4010}, but nothing can slow {CARDNAME:2030} and company's advance."

10013602,"The Ivory Order approaches the {CARDNAME:4010}, quite sure of their victory."
10013611,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013612,They shall have their quarry at this rate!
10013621,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10013622,What will you do?
10013631,Help Fight
10013632,You cannot stand idly by. You thrust yourself into the midst of battle!
10013641,Stay Back and Watch
10013642,"You can see the writing on the wall. You shrink away from the fight.

10016742,...but in your head echoes a familiar voice.
10016751,{CARDNAME:4020}
10016752,"There is no denying me.
This world will fall.
As will you."
10016761,{CARDNAME:4020}

10016791,
10016792,The Ivory Order trio leave your party.
10016801,{CARDNAME:4020}
10016802,The {CARDNAME:4020} screeches a bloodthirsty shriek as he bears down on you once again!
10016811,{CARDNAME:4020}
10016812,"Foul creatures, be cleansed by my power."
10016821,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10016822,The {CARDNAME:4020}'s power inhibits your actions.
10016831,{CARDNAME:4020}
10016832,The {CARDNAME:4020} gathers his immense strength. You have to do something...
10016841,"The Would-Be Hero
and Company"
10016842,...but the {CARDNAME:4020}'s power binds you!
10016851,{CARDNAME:1030}
10016852,"Struggling against his power, {CARDNAME:1030} recalls {CARDNAME:2040}'s final words."

10016922,"{CARDNAME:1030}'s powerful magic has bound the {CARDNAME:4020}!
That same power, though, has also bound her!"
10016931,"The Would-Be Hero

10016932,"Her spell breaks the power binding you. You can move freely again, and feel your strength return."
10016941,{CARDNAME:4020}
10016942,The spell has bound the {CARDNAME:4020}. Now's your chance to end this!
10016951,
10016952,{CARDNAME:1030} withdraws from battle. Take a moment to reorganize your party.

10017061,"The Would-Be Hero

10017062,You defeated the {CARDNAME:4020}!
10017071,{CARDNAME:2030}
10017072,"{CARDNAME:2030}, returned to his human form, seems not long for this world."
10017081,
10017082,"With an earsplitting roar, the {CARDNAME:4020} breaks free of the spell!"
10017091,
10017092,"Driven mad with rage, he attacks mercilessly!"
10017101,
10017102,There's nothing you can do to defend against the vicious onslaught.
10017111,
10017112,It seems the Mausoleum is to be your tomb...
10017121,
10017122,No way are you leaving without {CARDNAME:1030}!
10017131,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10017132,You rush to {CARDNAME:1030}'s side.
10017141,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017142,"The moment you reach her, you notice something strange..."
10017151,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017152,{CARDNAME:1030}'s transformed into a monster...!
10017161,The Ivory Order Trio
10017162,"Just then, {CARDNAME:1110} and the others return from their search of the area."
10017171,{CARDNAME:1110}
10017172,It seems the emergency stores of <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> kept in the altar were all dashed upon the ground during your battle with {CARDNAME:2030}.
10017181,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10017182,Despair buckles your knees. You've lost {CARDNAME:1030} and any hope of changing {CARDNAME:1020} back...
10017191,{CARDNAME:1110}
10017192,{CARDNAME:1110} slips something into your hand. You hold it up...
10017201,{CARDNAME:51112}
10017202,...and see the empty vial of <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> that {CARDNAME:2030} drank. But if you squint you can make out one last drop in the bottom.
10017211,
10017212,
10017221,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10017222,You got a vial of <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> from {CARDNAME:1110}!
10017231,
10017232,"The world, cut off from its supply of medicine with the {CARDNAME:4010}'s death."
10017241,
10017242,"Your twin, for whom you have searched high and low for some way of restoring her human form."
10017251,
10017252,"And {CARDNAME:1030}, transformed into a monster and lying prone before your very eyes."
10017261,
10017262,You must decide for which purpose to put the all-powerful <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight>.
10017271,
10017272,The final drop has been entrusted to you. Perhaps it will grant you your wish...
10017281,
10017282,...but there's always the chance it will fail. It isn't easy to wield the magic of <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight>.
10017291,
10017292,Perhaps <highlight>something</highlight> you've acquired during your adventure can help ensure your wish is properly granted.
10017301,
10017302,<highlight>ある物</highlight>を使うか？
10017311,Use It
10017312,使う
10017321,
10017322,この<highlight>不思議なカード</highlight>の力で、<highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight>の魔力を多少は制御できるだろう……
10017331,Don't Use It
10017332,使わないか……それもまた選択のひとつだ。
10017341,
10017342,それでは、改めて君に問おう。これが最後の質問だ。
10017351,
10017352,What will you use the {CARDNAME:51112} to wish for?
10017361,Change Melanie Back
10017362,You tip the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> over {CARDNAME:1030}'s prone form.
10017371,Change Mar Back
10017372,You tip the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> over {CARDNAME:1020}.
10017381,Bring the {CARDNAME:4010} Back
10017382,"Wishing for the {CARDNAME:4010}'s revival, you head toward the Volcano."
10017391,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10017392,"At the peak of the {CARDNAME:92070}, you tip the <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> into the roiling lava."
10017401,Wish for Everything
10017402,"As though you were trying to cling to something, you offer up every supplication to the Dragontear. And then..."
10017411,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017412,{CARDNAME:1030} turns back into a human!
10017421,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017422,"When she learns you used the {CARDNAME:51112} on her, {CARDNAME:1030} asks you why you didn't choose {CARDNAME:1020}."
10017431,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017432,"""You shouldn't have used the last {CARDNAME:51112} on me,"" she sobs."
10017441,
10017442,"After escaping the {CARDNAME:92080}, you take {CARDNAME:1030} and {CARDNAME:1020} with you on another sojourn round the realm."
10017451,
10017452,"{CARDNAME:1030} is as unforgiving toward you as always, but grows especially tender in taking care of {CARDNAME:1020}."
10017461,
10017462,"Deep, deep down, she feels guilty that only she returned to normal."
10017471,
10017472,Afterwards...
10017481,
10017482,News of the {CARDNAME:4010}'s imprisonment at the hands of the Ivory Order and the medicine they forced him to make spreads like wildfire.
10017491,
10017492,A rash of skirmishes breaks out over the increasingly rarer medicine that is the {CARDNAME:4010}'s legacy. Chaos envelops the realm.
10017501,Hint for the End
10017502,"If you collect all the <highlight>mysterious cards</highlight> and defeat the {CARDNAME:4020}, something special might happen."
10017511,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017512,{CARDNAME:1030}に{CARDNAME:51112}を使ってみたが、何も変化がない。どうも失敗したようだ……
10017521,
10017522,その後、君は魔物化した{CARDNAME:1030}と{CARDNAME:1020}を従え、再び世界を巡る旅に出る。
10017531,
10017532,しばらくのち、君は賞金稼ぎとしてではなく、二匹の魔物を従える魔物使いとして名声を得ることになる。
10017541,
10017542,しかし、{CARDNAME:4010}の死によって薬の供給が絶たれたことが世間に広まり……
10017551,
10017552,残された薬を求め、各地で抗争が勃発。世界は混沌への道を歩み始める……
10017561,{CARDNAME:1020}
10017562,{CARDNAME:1020} turns back into a human!
10017571,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10017572,You rush to her side and give her the biggest bear hug in the history of bear hugs.
10017581,{CARDNAME:1030}
10017582,The monstrous {CARDNAME:1030} looks on with a vacant stare.
10017591,
10017592,"After escaping the {CARDNAME:92080}, you take {CARDNAME:1030} and {CARDNAME:1020} with you on another sojourn round the realm."
10017601,
10017602,"Perhaps due to the length of time she spent as a monster, {CARDNAME:1020} has trouble speaking. The only thing that hasn't changed is her appetite."
10017611,
10017612,"{CARDNAME:1030}, on the other hand, follows the two of you everywhere you go in total silence."
10017621,
10017622,"You think she can understand your conversations, but you aren't sure how much of {CARDNAME:1030} is really left inside the monster..."
10017631,
10017632,Afterwards...
10017641,
10017642,News of the {CARDNAME:4010}'s imprisonment at the hands of the Ivory Order and the medicine they forced him to make spreads like wildfire.

10017711,{CARDNAME:4010}
10017712,The {CARDNAME:4010} comes back to life!
10017721,{CARDNAME:4010}
10017722,"""You sacrificed your own kin and comrades to help me?"" he asks softly. ""Foolish human."""
10017731,{CARDNAME:4010}
10017732,He launches into the sky. You watch him fly away into the distance.
10017741,
10017742,"After escaping the {CARDNAME:92080}, you take {CARDNAME:1030} and {CARDNAME:1020} with you on another sojourn round the realm."
10017751,
10017752,"You hope, one day, to find more <highlight>{CARDNAME:51112}</highlight> and turn them both human again."
10017761,
10017762,"Your reputation grows—not as a bounty hunter, but as a monster whisperer thanks to your two companions. It's not exactly how you envisioned getting famous."
10017771,
10017772,But that is a tale for another time.
10017781,
10017782,Afterwards...
10017791,
10017792,{CARDNAME:4010}の復活により薬の供給が再開された世界は、徐々に元の姿を取り戻していった。
10017801,

10017861,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10017921,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10017931,{CARDNAME:1050}
10017932,"{CARDNAME:1050} says you collapsed after the {CARDNAME:51112} started shining with fierce light, and that you've been unconscious ever since."

10017972,You return to Advent Castle and make your report of the events to {CARDNAME:2010}.
10017981,
10017982,"She rewards you handsomely for telling her the truth about the {CARDNAME:4010}, but it's barely enough to cover the cost of repairs to {CARDNAME:1040}'s home. "

10018011,
10018012,{CARDNAME:2010} denounces the Ivory Order for their cruelty and seizes control of medicinal production. She does all she can to ensure a more ethical manufacturing process.
10018021,
10018022,"{CARDNAME:1110}, {CARDNAME:1130}, and {CARDNAME:1120} leave the Ivory Order, establishing a new organization to help the needy."

10027071,Throw It In
10027072,"You turn toward the sea and heave the {CARDNAME:60102} into the air with all your might!
The pommel of a sword rises, glistening, from the waves."
10027081,Goddess of the Sea
10027082,"As it does, you hear a voice. ""Is this fine gleaming sword the one you cast into my waves?"" it asks."
10027091,
10027092,How do you answer?
10027101,"Yep, That's the One"
10027102,"""Yep, sure is!"" you respond, utterly shameless."
10027111,
10027112,"「嘘つきめ！」
と声が返ってきた。
そのまま剣は沈んでしまい後には何も残らなかった。"

10027152,"You right yourself, still holding it in your hand! It's...the same {CARDNAME:60102} you threw in. Your compatriots curse your hubris."
10027161,Goddess of the Sea
10027162,"""Liar!"" the voice booms.
Then, a moment later, ""Do you desire this blade?"""
10027171,Goddess of the Sea
10027172,"Yes, absolutely, you reply hastily. The voice speaks once more.
""That will be 1,000G."""
10027181,
10027182,What will you do?
10027191,Pay 1000G
10027192,"You heave 1,000G into the waves. The sword slowly rises from the water and floats gently onto the shore before you."
10027201,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10027202,"You take up the sword, heart racing with anticipation. Your brow furrows. There's nothing special about it at all! You could've bought this anywhere!"
10027211,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10027212,You received <highlight>{CARDNAME:60104}</highlight> in exchange for your {CARDNAME:60102} and 1000G!

10027242,"The waves return your {CARDNAME:60102} to you. The voice speaks once more.
""We look forward to doing business with you another time."""
10027251,"Nah, I'm Good"
10027252,"You tell the voice you don't need it, waving your hands.
""Please come again. Have a great day, now."""
10027261,"No, It Was
a {CARDNAME:60102}"
10027262,"""Nope, it was a {CARDNAME:60102},"" you answer honestly.
The sword dulls, slowly returning to a {CARDNAME:60102}."
10027271,Goddess of the Sea
10027272,"""And here I was so certain you would lie..."" the voice intones with a tinge of baffled disappointment. The {CARDNAME:60102} returns to you."

10027282,"""To the honest go the spoils. That's goddess policy."" All goes quiet."
10027291,
10027292,You obtain <highlight>100G</highlight>!

10027321,Goddess of the Sea
10027322,"""Do not give me your trash!"" the voice snaps. The waves hurl seemingly every bit of garbage that was ever tossed into the waves."

10027351,
10027352,光は一層強くなり、君はぎゅっと目を閉じた。しばらくしてから恐る恐る目を開いてみると……
10027361,
10027362,君の手には強い剣が握られていた。「正直者へのご褒美かも」と仲間の誰かがつぶやいた。
10027371,
10027372,君は鉄の剣を失ったが、代わりに<highlight>強い剣</highlight>を手に入れることができた！

10027451,Don't Drop It
10027452,"""That's just a waste of good equipment,"" you think to yourself, and take your leave."
10027461,
10027462,"However willing you might be, you don't have the armor depicted, so you walk away."
10027471,Drop It
10027472,"You pretend you never saw the sign and drop the armor into the hole.
""Hey!"" a voice shouts from within, clearly furious."
10027481,
10027482,"The voice carries on as a piece of armor, emitting its own blinding light, rises from the hole."
10027491,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

You respond..."
10027501,That's Right

10027552,You have lost your {CARDNAME:62120}...
10027561,
10027562,"「危ないだろう！」
そんな怒鳴り声と共に、穴の中から石コロやら鎧やらがポイポイ飛んできた。"
10027571,
10027572,君の頭に革の鎧がヒットする。石コロは仲間たちの肌を少し傷付けた。
10027581,
10027582,革の鎧を失わずに済んだが、君たちは<highlight>１のダメージ</highlight>を負ってしまった！
10027591,
10027592,"That will be 1,000G. Well?"
10027601,
10027602,"That will be 2,000G. Well?"

10027612,"That will be 4,000G. Well?"

10027622,"""You lie. However, I shall part with this armor for a price,"" the voice bargains."

10027641,Voice
10027642,"""If you cannot pay, then we are done here,"" the voice bellows. Your armor floats back out of the hole."
10027651,I'll Take That
10027652,You hastily drop the money into the hole and hoist the dazzling armor from its floating perch!
10027661,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10027662,"You examine it carefully, heart pounding from the thrill of the purchase. You raise an eyebrow. You've been tricked! This is perfectly ordinary armor!"
10027671,
10027672,"You received <highlight>{CARDNAME:62120}</highlight> in exchange for your {CARDNAME:62100} and 1,000G!"

10027702,"You politely decline the offer, only to be met with a brusque, ""Then get out of here, already!"" The armor you dropped into the hole re-emerges unscathed."
10027711,"No, It Was
Iron Armor"
10027712,"You surmise that lying will do you no good, so you tell the truth."
10027721,Voice
10027722,"""Your honesty is appreciated,"" comes the reply, followed by a call to stop dropping armor in any old hole. Your armor comes flying out of the hole along with your coin."
10027731,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10027732,"You thank the magnanimous voice, pick up your money and armor, and continue on your way."
10027741,"No, It Was

10027742,"You surmise that lying will do you no good, so you tell the truth."
10027751,"No, It Was
Frostmail"
10027752,"You surmise that lying will do you no good, so you tell the truth."
10027761,
10027762,"You re-obtain your armor, plus an extra <highlight>50G</highlight>!"
10027771,
10027772,"You re-obtain your armor, plus an extra <highlight>80G</highlight>!"
10027781,
10027782,"""Then you must be punished!"" the voice booms, as monsters leap out of the hole!"
10027791,
10027792,"Having dispatched the monsters, you turn to find the armor you dropped into the hole lying at your feet."
10027801,
10027802,And what's this? One of the monsters dropped their mint-condition weapon!
10027811,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10027812,You scoop up the armor and the little extra in one swift motion.
10027821,
10027822,"And what's this? There's an unopened bottle of medicine, too!"
10027831,
10027832,"「よく白状した！」
声の主は君を称え、頑丈そうな鎧を君の足元にゴロンと転がしてきた。"
10027841,
10027842,よく見ると、それは強い鎧だった！
10027851,
10027852,君は革の鎧を失ったが、代わりに<highlight>強い鎧</highlight>を手に入れることができた！
10027861,
10027862,荒地に禍々しい雰囲気を漂わせる穴を見つけた。すぐそばに、ボロを身にまとった老人が佇んでいる。
10027871,
10027872,老人は「使っていない守りの指輪があれば、穴に入れてみなされ」と言い、嫌な笑いを浮かべた。君は……
10027881,入れない
10027882,嫌な予感がしたので「結構です」と断り、急いでその場を離れた。
10027891,入れてみる
10027892,好奇心が勝り、指輪を入れてみたくなった。しかし残念なことに持ち合わせがなかった。
10027901,怪しい老人
10027902,"「残念だねぇ」
老人はさらに嫌らしく笑うと、なんと穴と共に霧となって消えてしまった。"
10027911,入れてみる
10027912,鞄の底に眠っていた守りの指輪を取り出すと、穴にポイと放り投げた。
10027921,
10027922,すると、穴の中からただならぬオーラを放つ指輪がふわりと浮かび上がった。
10027931,
10027932,"「この指輪の主は汝か？」
と不気味な声が聞こえてくる……。
君は何と答える？"
10027941,はい
10027942,君は指輪を見たとたん、どうしようもなくそれを自分のものにしたくなった。
10027951,
10027952,しばらくすると、穴を中心に霧が漂いはじめた。老人が「選ばれなかったか」とつぶやく。
10027961,
10027962,そして穴も指輪も、老人さえもが霧となって消えてしまった。
10027971,
10027972,君は守りの指輪を失ってしまった……
10027981,
10027982,すると、指輪は君の指にはまり、溶け込むように消えてしまった。
10027991,
10027992,老人は「選ばれた！」と叫んだ。しかし君の頭には「違う」という言葉が響いていた。
10028001,
10028002,この指輪は、君が持つべきものではなかったようだ。凶悪な力が君と仲間たちを襲い――
10028011,
10028012,守りの指輪は戻ってきたが、全員が<highlight>状態異常「呪い」</highlight>になってしまった！
10028021,
10028022,穴も老人も消え去り、後には守りの指輪が残されていた……
10028031,
10028032,"「返してほしくば1000G払え……」と言われてしまった。
君は1000Gを……"
10028041,払う
10028042,ここまで来たからには最後まで付き合ってやろうと、君は1000Gを支払った。
10028051,
10028052,老人は「良い選択じゃ」と満足げに笑い、穴と共に霧となって消えていった。
10028061,
10028062,君は守りの指輪を失い、1000Gで<highlight>耐呪の指輪</highlight>を手に入れた！
10028071,払う
10028072,思わず払うと言ってしまった君だが、財布の中にはそこまでのお金は入っていない。
10028081,
10028082,「残念だ」と言う声が聞こえた後、穴も指輪も、老人までもが霧となり消えてしまった。
10028091,
10028092,穴があった場所には、君のものだった守りの指輪だけが残されていた……
10028101,払わない
10028102,君は正体もわからない指輪に1000Gも払う気になれなかった。
10028111,
10028112,老人はもったいないとつぶやきながら、穴と共に消えていった。後には守りの指輪が残されていた。
10028121,いいえ
10028122,君は穴から凶悪な気配を感じとり、本能的に真実を答えていた。すると……
10028131,
10028132,"「騙されぬとは……」
老人が悔しげにつぶやくと霧が老人の体を包みはじめた。"
10028141,
10028142,やがて老人も穴も消え去り後には守りの指輪だけが残されていた。
10028151,
10028152,危険は去り、守りの指輪も戻ってきたので、ようやく君は安心することができたのだった。
10028161,
10028162,老人の姿が魔物へと変化した！穴からも続々と魔物が出てくる。老人だったものは「失敗だ！」と叫んだ。
10028171,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10028172,「これは返してもらうぞ」と、君はカッコよく魔物から守りの指輪を取り返した。
10028181,老人だった魔物
10028182,すると老人だった魔物は、「これでご勘弁を」と、君に鉄の剣を差し出した。
10028191,
10028192,君は守りの指輪を取り返したうえ、<highlight>鉄の剣</highlight>を手に入れることができた！
10028201,
10028202,緊迫感に包まれていた空気が一気に弛緩するのがわかった。
10028211,
10028212,老人は穴の上に浮いている指輪を手にすると、「君こそが相応しい」と言ってそれを君の手に握らせた。
10028221,
10028222,それは美しい装飾が施された高そうな指輪だった。
10028231,
10028232,お礼を言おうと顔を上げると、もうそこに老人の姿はなかった。穴も老人と一緒に消えてしまったようだった。
10028241,
10028242,君は守りの指輪を失ったが代わりに<highlight>耐闇の指輪</highlight>を手に入れることができた！
10028251,
10028252,"「助けてください……！」
君の前に男がひとり飛び出してきた。魔物に襲われたらしく、全身ボロボロだ。"
10028261,かわいそうな男
10028262,怪我の応急手当をしてやると、男は君の手を握り締めて縋るような目を向けてきた。
10028271,かわいそうな男
10028272,「旅のついでで結構です！私をミツメの街まで連れて行って頂けませんか！？」
10028281,
10028282,男は君だけが頼りのようだ。<highlight>ミツメの街</highlight>まで連れて行ってやろうか……？
10028291,連れて行く
10028292,彼をこのままにしてはおけないので、ミツメの街まで連れて行くことにした。
10028301,
10028302,旅の途中で<highlight>ミツメの街</highlight>に立ち寄ってあげよう。
10028311,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10028312,君は男に付いて来るよう告げると、背中を向けて歩き出した。すると……
10028321,かわいそうな男
10028322,"「お人好しの冒険者さん、荷物を全部寄越しな」
男は君の背中にナイフを突きつけ、耳元でそうつぶやいた。"
10028331,かわいそうな男
10028332,なんと、男は盗賊だった！
10028341,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10028342,しかし君もそこまでヤワな冒険者ではない。君は男の隙を突いて素早く距離を取ると、剣を構えた。
10028351,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10028352,君は悪態をついて逃げてゆく盗賊を見ながら、次こそは騙されないぞと心に固く誓うのだった。
10028361,断る
10028362,君は危険な旅路に男性を同行させるわけにはいかないと思い、残念だがそれはできないと答えた。
10028371,
10028372,男はガックリと肩を落とすと、ミツメの街に向かってトボトボと歩いてゆくのだった……
10028381,
10028382,君たちがミツメの街へ入ろうとすると、街の中からやつれた女性が駆け寄ってきた。
10028391,やつれた女性
10028392,女性は、君が旅の途中に助けた男と熱い抱擁を交わして再会を喜び合う。女性と男は夫婦だったようだ。
10028401,かわいそうな男
10028402,男は君にここまで連れてきてくれたお礼を告げ、妻の持っていた籠の中から薬のビンを謝礼品として差し出した。
10028411,
10028412,君は<highlight>上傷薬</highlight>を手に入れた！
10028421,かわいそうな男
10028422,男は君にここまで連れてきてくれたお礼を告げると、少ないですがと言い添えて謝礼金を差し出した。
10028431,

10032571,Old Man
10032572,"""Come to console me, have you?"" he says sweetly, petting each of them gently."
10032581,Old Man

10033452,"You press on, deeper into the cave. Light floods into the chamber, illuminating a scene so startling you nearly drop the torch altogether."
10033461,
10033462,"Two mummified bodies lie close beside one another, their hands clasped together."
10033471,
10033472,"Beside them, a message written in blood.

""WE LEAVE TOGETHER"""
10033481,
10033482,"Perhaps they were lovers? Whatever the case, you notice the Bellwether nestled in their hands."

10033522,"近くの壁に、爪で引っかいたような傷があった。
「タスケテ」
と書いてあるようだ。"
10033531,
10033532,これを書いた人間は、恐らくここで……
10033541,
10033542,君が何者かの気配を察知すると同時に、目の前に魔物が現れた！
10033551,"Eager Ivory Order
Disciple"
10033552,A disciple of the Ivory Order stands in your way.
10033561,"Eager Ivory Order
Disciple"
10033562,"""The Order shall bring peace to the realm,"" he declares as he advances on you."

10033591,"Timid Ivory Order
Disciple"
10033592,"""I'm sick and tired of this,"" she says, even as she storms toward you, weapon drawn."
10033601,"Timid Ivory Order
Disciple"
10033602,"Trembling all over, the Ivory Order disciple stumbles away on unsteady legs."
10033611,Ivory Order Disciple
10033612,"You see a disciple of the Ivory Order shouldering a bag of medicine bottles. ""Would you like to buy some salves for your journey?"" she asks."
10033621,
10033622,Will you buy some of her medicine?
10033631,Buy
10033632,You ask her to show you her wares. She lines up several medicines before you.
10033641,Don't Buy
10033642,"There is nothing you need to buy, so you politely refuse her offer and continue on your way."
10033651,Ivory Order Disciple
10033652,"""Pray, take care of yourselves,"" she says as she continues on her way."

10033681,Leave Later
10033682,You decide to stay and explore the cave a little longer.
10033691,
10033692,Quite some time has passed since you entered the {CARDNAME:92030}. Would you mind sharing your reason for lingering here?
10033701,
10033702,What are you doing?
10033711,Lost the Way
10033712,You wander the woods with single-minded devotion... It would seem you are hopelessly lost.
10033721,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033722,"When, what do you know, your next destination is mysteriously projected in the back of your mind."
10033731,Fighting Monsters
10033732,You take advantage of the many a monster who call this wood home to polish your swordsmanship.
10033741,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033742,"Naturally, leaving no coin they drop uncollected."
10033751,Nothing
10033752,"With no particular goal in mind, you loiter about the Bewildering Wood..."
10033761,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033762,Soothed by the breeze rustling through the trees.
10033771,{CARDNAME:92040}
10033772,Your footing is obscured in the dimness of the shrine. You should probably proceed with caution.
10033781,Go Carefully
10033782,"You go forth slowly but steadily, taking it one step at a time."
10033791,Barge On Ahead
10033792,"Rushing forward, you slip and fall flat on your face!"
10033801,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}

10033811,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033812,"As you sit up, you realize your clothing is covered in something wet and sticky..."
10033821,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033822,You take a good look at the floor and see it lined in trails of viscous liquid. No doubt a {CARDNAME:10110} or two hundred have passed through here.
10033831,
10033832,"It seems like you can return to the floor you were just on, but only once. What will you do?"
10033841,Go Back
10033842,You are assailed with a sudden dizzy spell and feel your consciousness fading...
10033851,
10033852,You realize that you're back at the entrance of the floor. That dreadful falling feeling in the pit of your stomach must have been your imagination...
10033861,Don't Go Back
10033862,You decide to rescale the tower on your own.
10033871,Lava River
10033872,A river of lava flows before you. It looks like you won't be able to go any further.
10033881,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033882,Will you still try to press on ahead?
10033891,I Want to Keep Going
10033892,"You sit and think, desperate to cross the river by any means necessary, when inspiration strikes."
10033901,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033902,"Reckless though it may be, you backtrack several feet before rushing at the river, ready to leap across when—"
10033911,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033912,You trip over a pebble in your path and stumble pathetically to the ground...
10033921,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033922,"You scrape your knee, taking <highlight>3</highlight> damage!"
10033931,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10033932,"As you sit on the ground, nursing your injured knee, you spot something shiny nearby."

10034021,
10034022,"Now then, this is the end of your long journey, which means you and I must regrettably part ways..."
10034031,
10034032,I hope we meet again in the world of <highlight>Voice of Cards</highlight>.
10034041,
10034042,It's been a pleasure.
10034051,{CHARACTERNAME:1010}
10034052,A realization confronts your urge to shop: you can't buy anything with the meager money in your possession.
10034061,
10034062,Do you want...more money?

10034072,You obtain <highlight>20G</highlight>!
